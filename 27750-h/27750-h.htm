<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE.</h2>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>In preparing this brief sketch of the most
celebrated of our naval heroes, the author has
been aided by the very full and valuable biography
published in 1878 by his son, Mr. Loyall
Farragut, who has also kindly supplied for
this work many additional details of interest
from the Admiral's journals and correspondence,
and from other memoranda. For the
public events connected with Farragut's career,
either directly or indirectly, recourse has
been had to the official papers, as well as to
the general biographical and historical literature
bearing upon the war, which each succeeding
year brings forth in books or magazines.
The author has also to express his
thanks to Rear-Admiral Thornton A. Jenkins,
formerly chief-of-staff to Admiral Farragut; to
Captain John Crittenden Watson, formerly his
flag-lieutenant; and to his friend General James
Grant Wilson, for interesting anecdotes and
reminiscences.</p>

<h3>FAMILY AND EARLY LIFE.<br /><br />

1801-1811.</h3>

<p>The father of Admiral Farragut, George Farragut,
was of unmixed Spanish descent, having been
born on the 29th of September, 1755, in the island
of Minorca, one of the Balearic group, where the
family had been prominent for centuries. One of his
ancestors, Don Pedro Ferragut, served with great
distinction under James I, King of Aragon, in the
wars against the Moors, which resulted in their expulsion
from Majorca in 1229, and from the kingdom
of Valencia, in the Spanish Peninsula, in 1238.
As Minorca in 1755 was a possession of the British
Crown, to which it had been ceded in 1713 by the
Treaty of Utrecht, George Farragut was born under
the British flag; but in the following year a French
expedition, fitted out in Toulon, succeeding in wresting
from the hands of Great Britain both the island
and its excellent fortified harbor, Port Mahon, one
of the most advantageous naval stations in the
Mediterranean. It was in the course of the operations
which resulted in this conquest of Minorca by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the French that the British fleet, under the command
of Admiral Byng, met with the check for which the
admiral paid the penalty of his life a few months
later. At the close of the Seven Years' War, in 1763,
the island was restored to Great Britain, in whose
hands it remained until 1782, when it was again retaken
by the French and Spaniards.</p>

<p>George Farragut, however, had long before severed
his connection with his native country. In
March, 1776, he emigrated to North America, which
was then in the early throes of the Revolutionary
struggle. Having grown to manhood a subject to
Great Britain, but alien in race and feeling, he naturally
espoused the cause of the colonists, and served
gallantly in the war. At its end he found himself,
like the greater part of his adopted countrymen,
called to the task of building up his own fortunes,
neglected during its continuance; and, by so doing,
to help in restoring prosperity to the new nation. A
temper naturally adventurous led him to the border
lines of civilization; and it was there, in the region
where North Carolina and eastern Tennessee meet,
that the years succeeding the Revolution appear
mainly to have been passed. It was there also that
he met and married his wife, Elizabeth Shine, a
native of Dobbs County, North Carolina, where she
was born on the 7th of June, 1765. At the time of
their marriage the country where they lived was
little more than a wilderness, still infested by Indians;
and one of the earliest recollections of the
future admiral was being sent into the loft, on the
approach of a party of these, while his mother with
an axe guarded the door, which she had barricaded.
This unsettled and dangerous condition necessitated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
a constant state of preparedness, with some organization
of the local militia, among whom George Farragut
held the rank of a major of cavalry, in which
capacity he served actively for some time.</p>

<p>While resident in Tennessee, George Farragut
became known to Mr. W. C. C. Claiborne, at that
time the member for Tennessee in the National
House of Representatives. Mr. Claiborne in 1801
became governor of Mississippi Territory; and in
1803, when the United States purchased from France
the great region west of the Mississippi River, to
which the name Louisiana was then applied, he
received the cession of the newly acquired possession.
This was soon after divided into two parts by
a line following the thirty-third parallel of north latitude,
and Claiborne became governor of the southern
division, which was called the Territory of Orleans.
To this may probably be attributed the removal of
the Farraguts to Louisiana from eastern Tennessee.
The region in which the latter is situated, remote
both from tide-water and from the great river by
which the Western States found their way to the Gulf
of Mexico, was singularly unfitted to progress under
the conditions of communication in that day; and it
long remained among the most backward and primitive
portions of the United States. The admiral's
father, after his long experience there, must have
seen that there was little hope of bettering his fortunes.
Whatever the cause, he moved to Louisiana
in the early years of the century, and settled his
family in New Orleans. He himself received the
appointment of sailing-master in the navy, and was
ordered to command a gun-boat employed in the river
and on the adjacent sounds. A dispute had arisen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
between the United States and the Spanish Government,
to whom the Floridas then belonged, as to the
line of demarcation between the two territories; and
George Farragut was at times employed with his
vessel in composing disturbances and forwarding the
views of his own government.</p>

<p>David Glasgow, the second son of George Farragut,
and the future Admiral of the United States
Navy, was born before the removal to Louisiana, on
the 5th of July, 1801, at Campbell's Station, near
Knoxville, in eastern Tennessee. In 1808, while living
in his father's house on the banks of Lake Pontchartrain,
an incident occurred which led directly
to his entrance into the navy, and at the same time
brought into curious coincidence two families, not
before closely associated, whose names are now
among the most conspicuous of those in the annals
of the navy. While George Farragut was fishing one
day on Lake Pontchartrain he fell in with a boat, also
engaged in fishing, in which was an old gentleman
prostrated by the heat of the sun. He took him to
his own house, where he was cared for and nursed
until he died, never having recovered strength sufficient
to be removed. The sufferer was David Porter,
the father of the Captain David Porter who afterward
commanded the frigate Essex in her adventurous
and celebrated cruise in the Pacific during the
years 1813 and 1814, and grandfather of the still more
distinguished Admiral David D. Porter, who, over
half a century later, served with David Farragut on
the Mississippi in the civil war, and in the end succeeded
him as second admiral of the navy. Captain,
or rather, as he then was, Commander Porter being
in charge of the naval station at New Orleans, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
father, who had served actively afloat during the
Revolution and had afterward been appointed by
Washington a sailing-master in the navy, had obtained
orders to the same station, in order to be with,
though nominally under, his son. The latter deeply
felt the kindness shown to his father by the Farraguts.
Mrs. Farragut herself died of yellow fever, toward the
end of Mr. Porter's illness, the funeral of the two taking
place on the same day; and Commander Porter
soon after visited the family at their home and offered
to adopt one of the children. Young David Farragut
then knew little of the element upon which his future
life was to be passed; but, dazzled by the commander's
uniform and by that of his own elder
brother William, who had received a midshipman's
warrant a short time before, he promptly decided to
accept an offer which held forth to him the same
brilliant prospects. The arrangement was soon concluded.
Porter promised to be to him always a
friend and guardian; and the admiral wrote in after
life, "I am happy to have it in my power to say, with
feelings of the warmest gratitude, that he ever was to
me all that he promised." The boy returned to New
Orleans with his new protector, in whose house he
thenceforth resided, making occasional trips across
Lake Pontchartrain to a plantation which his father
had purchased on the Pascagoula River. A few
months later Commander Porter appears to have
made a visit to Washington on business connected
with the New Orleans station, and to have taken
Farragut with him to be placed at school, for which
there were few advantages at that time in Louisiana.
The boy then took what proved to be a last farewell
of his father. George Farragut continued to live<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in Pascagoula, and there he died on the 4th of June,
1817, in his sixty-second year.</p>

<p>The trip north was made by Porter and his ward
in the bomb-ketch Vesuvius, a stop being made at
Havana; where the commander had business growing
out of the seizure by him in the Mississippi River
of some French privateers, for which both Spain and
the United States had offered a reward. At Havana
the lad heard of an incident, only too common in those
days, which set his heart, as those of his countrymen
were fast being set, against Great Britain. Presuming
confidently upon the naval weakness of the
United States, and arguing from their long forbearance
that insults to the flag would be indefinitely
borne for the sake of the profitable commerce which
neutrality insured, Great Britain, in order to support
the deadly struggle in which she was engaged with
France, had endeavored to shut off the intercourse
of her enemy with the rest of the world, by imposing
upon neutral trade restrictions before unheard of
and without justification in accepted international
law. Both the justice and policy of these restrictions
were contested by a large party of distinguished
Englishmen; but upon another principle men of all
parties in the old country were practically agreed,
and that was the right of the British Government to
compel the services of British seamen wherever
found. From this grew the claim, which few Englishmen
then dared to disavow, that their ships of
war could rightfully take from any neutral merchant
ship any seaman of British birth who was found on
board. In estimating this monstrous pretention,
Americans have shown little willingness to allow for
the desperate struggle in which Great Britain was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
involved, and the injury which she suffered from the
number of her seamen who, to escape impressment
in their home ports and the confinement of ships of
war, sought service in neutral merchant ships. Her
salvation depended upon her navy; and seamen were
so scarce as seriously to injure its efficiency and
threaten paralysis. This was naturally no concern of
the United States, which set up its simple, undeniable
right to the protection the neutral flag should
give to all persons and goods under it, which were
not involved in any infraction of belligerent rights.
The straits of Great Britain, however, were too dire
to allow the voice of justice to override that of expediency.
Had the United States Navy been a force
as respectable in numbers as it was in efficiency, the
same dictates of expediency might have materially
controlled the action of her opponent; might have
prevented outrage and averted war. As it was, right
was set up against right&mdash;the right of the neutral
flag on the one hand against the right of a country
to the service of all her citizens on the other. The
United States protested and wrote with all the conviction
of a state upon whose side justice was. She
resorted to measure after measure of peaceable coercion;
but she had no military force to show upon
the sea, and her utterances were consequently too
uncertain to command respect. Great Britain continued
to take seamen from American merchant
ships upon the plea of her right to impress British
seamen in any place; and, though the claim to detain
or search ships of war had been explicitly disavowed
after the Chesapeake affair of 1807, scant deference
was shown to the vessels of a power so little able to
stand up for itself. In a day when most vessels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
carried some guns for self-defense, it was a simple
matter to ignore the national character of an armed
ship and to stop it unceremoniously. Of such an
insult Farragut heard during this stay in Havana.
The brig Vixen, of the United States Navy, had been
fired into by a British ship of war. "This," wrote
Farragut in his journal, "was the first thing that
caused in me bad feeling toward the English nation.
I was too young to know anything about the Revolution;
but I looked upon this as an insult to be paid
in kind, and was anxious to discharge the debt with
interest." It is scarcely necessary to say how keenly
this feeling was shared by his seniors in the
service, to whom the Vixen incident was but one
among many bitter wrongs which the policy of their
Government had forced them humbly to swallow.</p>

<p>After their arrival in Washington Farragut was
put to school, where he remained until Porter was
relieved from the New Orleans station. During his
stay at the capital he was presented by his guardian
to the Secretary of the Navy, Paul Hamilton, of
South Carolina; who, after ascertaining his wish to
enter the service, promised him a midshipman's warrant
when he should be ten years old. The promise
was more than kept, for the warrant, when issued,
was dated December 17, 1810; the future admiral
thus finding himself at least a titular officer, in the
service which he was afterward to adorn, when not
quite nine and a half years of age. Although at
that time, and in earlier generations, boys, no older
than Farragut then was, were not infrequently turned
aboard ship to fight their own way in life, Porter did
not so construe his duties to his charge. In the latter
part of 1810 he finally left New Orleans and went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
North again, this time by the Mississippi River and
in a gun-boat. The voyage to Pittsburg against the
swift current took three months; and it was not till
toward the close of the year that he and his family
were again settled in their home at Chester, in Pennsylvania,
the birthplace of Mrs. Porter. Farragut
was then removed from Washington and put to
school in Chester, there to remain until his guardian
should be able to take him to sea under his own
eyes, in a vessel commanded by himself. This opportunity
was not long in arriving.</p>

<h3>CRUISE OF THE ESSEX.<br /><br />

1811-1814.</h3>


<p>Child though Farragut was when he obtained
his nominal admission to the navy, he had but a short
time to wait before entering upon its stern realities&mdash;realities
far harsher in that day than now. The
difficulties that had existed between the United States
and Great Britain, ever since the outbreak of war
between the latter and France in 1793, were now fast
drifting both nations to the collision of 1812. The
Non-intercourse Act of March, 1809, forbidding
American merchant ships to enter any port of France
or Great Britain, as a retaliation for the outrages inflicted
by both upon American commerce, had expired
by its own limitations in May, 1810, when commerce
with the two countries resumed its natural
course; but Congress had then passed a proviso to
the effect that if either power should, before March
3, 1811, recall its offensive measures, the former act
should, within three months of such revocation, revive
against the one that maintained its edicts. Napoleon
had contrived to satisfy the United States
Government that his celebrated Berlin and Milan
decrees had been recalled on the 1st of November;
and, consequently, non-intercourse with Great Britain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
was again proclaimed in February, 1811. The immediate
result was that two British frigates took
their station off New York, where they overhauled
all merchant ships, capturing those bound to ports
of the French Empire, and impressing any members
of the crews considered to be British subjects. The
United States then fitted out a squadron, to be commanded
by Commodore John Rodgers; whose orders,
dated May 6, 1811, were to cruise off the coast and
to protect American commerce from unlawful interference
by British and French cruisers. Ten days
later occurred the collision between the commodore's
ship, the President, and the British corvette Little
Belt. Of Rodgers's squadron the frigate Essex, expected
shortly to arrive from Europe, was to be one;
and Commander Porter, who did not obtain his promotion
to the grade of captain until the following
year, was ordered to commission her. He took his
ward with him, and the two joined the ship at Norfolk,
Virginia, in August, 1811, when the young midshipman
had just passed his tenth birthday. Long years
afterward Mrs. Farragut was told by Commodore
Bolton, one of the lieutenants of the Essex, that he
remembered to have found the little boy overcome
with sleep upon his watch, leaning against a gun-carriage,
and had covered him with his pea-jacket to
protect him from the night air. An amusing incident,
however, which occurred during these first
months of his naval career showed that the spirit of
battle was already stirring. Porter, probably with a
view to keep the lad more immediately under his
own eye, had made him midshipman of his gig, as
the captain's special boat is called. On one occasion
he was sent in to the wharf, to wait for the captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and bring him to the ship when he came. A crowd
of dock-loungers gradually collected, and the youngster
who stood erect in the boat, doubtless looking
pleasedly conscious of his new uniform and importance,
became the object of audible comment upon
his personal appearance. The boat's crew sat silent
but chafing, the bowman holding on with his boat-hook,
until one loafer proceeded from witticism to
practical joking by sprinkling the midshipman with
an old water-pot. Quick as look the bowman caught
his boot-hook in the culprit's pocket and dragged
him into the boat, while the rest of the crew, by
this time spoiling for a fight, seized their stretchers,
jumped ashore, and began laying on right and left.
Farragut, so far from restraining, went with them,
waving his dirk and cheering them on. The victorious
seamen fought their way up to Market Square,
where the police interfered, arresting all parties, and
the little officer was formally bound over to keep the
peace.</p>

<p>The Hartford, upon which Farragut first hoisted
his admiral's flag, has obtained a particular interest
from its close association with the whole of his course
of victory; and the Essex, a ship of very different
type, would attract attention as the one that cradled
his career, and witnessed the part of it which is only
second in excitement to his exploits as a commander-in-chief,
had she no special claims of her own to notice.
But the Essex, both in her origin and through
her subsequent history, especially when under Porter's
command, was a marked ship. She was an offspring
of the quarrel between the United States and
the French Republic, which arose out of the extravagant
demands made by the latter upon the compli<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>ance
of her former ally, in consequence of the service
which it was claimed had been rendered during the
Revolutionary War. Ignoring the weakness of the
American Republic, and the dependence of a large
section of the country upon commerce, the French
Government had expected that it should resist, even
by force, the seizure by British cruisers of French
property in American vessels, and thus bring on hostilities
with Great Britain; and that, although the
United States Government admitted the practice of
capturing enemy's property in neutral ships, however
objectionable in theory, to be part of the traditional
and recognized law of nations. Going on from
step to step, in the vain endeavor by some means to
injure the maritime predominance of Great Britain,
which defied the efforts both of their navy and of
their privateers, the French Legislature in January,
1798, decreed that any neutral vessel which should
be found to have on board, not merely British property,
but property, to whomsoever belonging, which
was grown or manufactured in England or her colonies,
should be a lawful prize to French cruisers.
This extravagant claim, which not only seized goods
that had been heretofore and by all others accounted
free, but also, contrary to precedent, confiscated the
vessel as well as the cargo, broke down the patience
of the United States, where the Government was
then still in the hands of the Federalists, whose sympathies
were rather British than French. Nearly a
year before, President Adams had called a special
meeting of Congress and recommended an increase
of the navy, to the numerical weakness of which was
due the recklessness with which both Great Britain
and France inflicted insult and injury upon our sea<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>men
and upon our commerce. That the United
States of that day, so inferior in wealth and numbers
to both belligerents, should dream of entering the
lists with either singly, was perhaps hopeless; but
through the indifference of Congress the navy of a
people, then second only to the English as maritime
carriers, was left so utterly impotent that it counted
for naught, even as an additional embarrassment to
those with which the contending powers were already
weighted. When, therefore, in retaliation for the
seizures made under the French decree of January,
1798, Congress, without declaring war, directed the
capture of French armed vessels, wherever found on
the high seas, it became necessary to begin building
a navy which to some slight degree might carry out
the order. An act, intended to hasten the increase
of the navy, was passed in June, 1798, authorizing
the President to accept such vessels as might be
built by the citizens for the national service, and to
issue six-per-cent stock to indemnify the subscribers.</p>

<p>Under this law the Essex was built in Salem,
Massachusetts, by a subscription raised among the
citizens. As the project grew, and the amount likely
to be obtained became manifest, the purpose to which
it should be devoted was determined to be the building
of a frigate of thirty-two guns; one of the well-recognized,
but smaller, classes under which the
vessels called frigates were subdivided. Except the
work of the naval architect proper, the model and
the superintendence, which were undertaken by a gentleman
from Portsmouth, everything in the building
and equipment was portioned out among Salem men,
and was supplied from the resources of the town or
of the surrounding country. During the winter of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
1798 to 1799 the sleds of all the farmers in the
neighborhood were employed bringing in the timber
for the frames and planking of the new ship.
The rigging was manufactured by the three ropewalks
then in the place, each undertaking one mast;
and the sails were of cloth so carefully selected and
so admirably cut that it was noticed the frigate never
again sailed so well as with this first suit. When
the rope cables, which alone were then used by ships
instead of the chains of the present day, were completed,
the workmen took them upon their shoulders
and marched with them in procession to the vessel,
headed by a drum and fife. The building of the
Essex was thus an effort of city pride and local
patriotism; and the launch, which took place on the
30th of September, 1799, became an occasion of general
rejoicing and holiday, witnessed by thousands
of spectators and greeted by salutes from the battery
and shipping. The new frigate measured 850
tons, and cost, independent of guns and stores, somewhat
over $75,000. Her battery in her early history
was composed of twenty-six long twelve-pounders on
the main deck, with sixteen thirty-two-pound carronades
and two chase guns on the deck above. At a
later day, and during the cruise under Porter, this
was changed to forty thirty-two-pound carronades
and six long twelves. This battery, though throwing
a heavier weight, was of shorter range than the
former; and therefore, though advantageous to a
ship able to choose her position, was a fatal source of
weakness to a slow or crippled vessel, as was painfully
apparent in the action where the Essex was lost.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the zeal and emulation aroused
by the appeal to Salem municipal pride, and notwith<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>standing
the comparative rapidity with which ships
could then be built, the Essex in her day illustrated
the folly of deferring preparation until hostilities
are at hand. The first French prize was taken in
June, 1798, but it was not till December 22d of the
following year that the Essex sailed out of Salem
harbor, commanded then by Edward Preble, one of
the most distinguished officers of the early American
navy. Newport was her first port of arrival. From
there she sailed again on the 6th of January, 1800, in
company with the frigate Congress, both being bound
for Batavia, whence they were to convoy home a fleet
of merchant ships; for in the predatory warfare encouraged
by the French Directory, the protection of
our commerce from its cruisers was a duty even more
important than the retaliatory action against the
latter, to which the <i>quasi</i> war of 1798 was confined.
When six days out, the Congress was dismasted.
The Essex went on alone, and was thus the first
ship-of-war to carry the flag of the United States
around the Cape of Good Hope into the Indian
Ocean. A dozen years later the bold resolution of
Porter to take her alone and unsupported into the
Pacific, during the cruise upon which young Farragut
was now embarking, secured for this little frigate the
singular distinction of being the first United States
ship-of-war to double Cape Horn as well as that of
Good Hope. In the intervening period the Essex
had been usefully, but not conspicuously, employed in
the Mediterranean in the operations against Tripoli
and in protecting trade. In 1811, however, she was
again an actor in an event of solemn significance.
Upon her return to the United States, where Porter
was waiting to take command, she bore as a passen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>ger
William Pinkney, the late Minister to Great
Britain; who, after years of struggle, on his part
both resolute and dignified, to obtain the just demands
of the United States, had now formally broken
off the diplomatic relations between the two powers
and taken an unfriendly leave of the British Government.</p>

<p>Being just returned from a foreign cruise, the
Essex needed a certain amount of refitting before
again going to sea under her new commander; but
in October, 1811, she sailed for a short cruise on the
coast, in furtherance of the Government's orders to
Commodore Rodgers to protect American commerce
from improper interference. Orders of such a character
were likely at any moment to result in a collision,
especially in the hands of a gallant, hasty officer
scarcely out of his first youth; for Porter was at this
time but thirty-one, and for years had felt, with the
keen resentment of a military man, the passive submission
to insult shown by Jefferson's government.
No meeting, however, occurred; nor were the months
that elapsed before the outbreak of war marked by
any event of special interest except a narrow escape
from shipwreck on Christmas eve, when the Essex
nearly dragged on shore in a furious northeast gale
under the cliffs at Newport. Farragut has left on
record in his journal, with the proper pride of a midshipman
in his ship, that the Essex was the smartest
vessel in the squadron, and highly complimented
as such by Commodore Rodgers. In acknowledgment
of the skill and activity of his seamen, Porter
divided the ship's company into three watches, instead
of the usual two&mdash;an arrangement only possible
when the smaller number in a watch is compensated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
by their greater individual efficiency. This arrangement
continued throughout the cruise, until the ship
was captured in 1814.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June, 1812, war was at last declared
against Great Britain. The Essex had again
been cruising during the spring months; but the
serious character of the new duties before her made
a thorough refit necessary, and she was not able to
sail with the squadron under Commodore Rodgers,
which put to sea from New York on the 21st of
June. On the 3d of July, however, she got away,
Porter having the day before received his promotion
to post-captain, then the highest grade in the United
States Navy. The ship cruised off the coast, making
several prizes of vessels much inferior to herself in
force, and on the 7th of September anchored within
the capes of the Delaware. Much to Porter's surprise
and annoyance, although ready to sail at once
if furnished with provisions, none reached him. The
ship was therefore taken up the Delaware and anchored
off Chester, where she was prepared for a
long and distant cruise directed against British commerce,
the suggestion of which Porter believed came
first from himself. By this a squadron consisting
of the Constitution, Essex, and Hornet sloop-of-war,
under the command of Commodore Bainbridge in
the first-named frigate, were to proceed across the
Atlantic to the Cape Verde Islands, thence to the
South Atlantic in the neighborhood of Brazil, and
finally to the Pacific, to destroy the British whale-fishery
there. The plan was well conceived, and
particularly was stamped with the essential mark of
all successful commerce-destroying, the evasion of
the enemy's cruisers; for, though the American<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
cruisers were primed to fight, yet an action, even if
successful, tended to cripple their powers of pursuit.
A rapid transit through the Atlantic, with an ultimate
destination to the then little-frequented Pacific,
was admirably calculated to conceal for a long time
the purposes of this commerce-destroying squadron.
As it happened, both the Constitution and Hornet
met and captured enemy's cruisers off the coast
of Brazil, and then returned to the United States.
Farragut thus lost the opportunity of sharing in any
of the victories of 1812, to be a partaker in one of
the most glorious of defeats.</p>

<p>The Constitution and Hornet being in Boston,
and the Essex in the Delaware, it became necessary
to appoint for the three a distant place of meeting,
out of the usual cruising grounds of the enemy, in
order that the ships, whose first object was to escape
crippling, could pass rapidly through the belt of British
cruisers then girding the coast of the United
States. The brilliant record made by United States
ships in their single combats with the enemy during
this war should not be allowed to blind our people
to the fact that, from their numerical inferiority,
they were practically prisoners in their own ports;
and, like other prisoners, had to break jail to gain
freedom to act. The distant and little frequented
Cape Verde group, off the African coast, was therefore
designated as the first rendezvous for Bainbridge's
squadron, and the lonely island of Fernando
Noronha, off the coast of Brazil, close under the
equator, as the second. Both of these places were
then possessions of Portugal, the ally of Great Britain
though neutral as to the United States. With
these orders the Constitution and Hornet sailed from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Boston on the 26th of October, 1812, and the Essex
two days later from the capes of the Delaware.
Their course in the passage was to be so directed as
to cross at the most favorable points the routes of
British commerce.</p>

<p>On the 27th of November the Essex, after an uneventful
voyage, anchored at Porto Praya, in the
Cape Verdes, where she remained five days. Receiving
no news of Bainbridge, Porter sailed again
for Fernando Noronha. On the 11th of December
a British packet, the Nocton, was captured, and
from her was taken $55,000 in specie&mdash;an acquisition
which contributed much to facilitate the distant
cruise contemplated by Porter. Four days later the
Essex was off Fernando Noronha, and sent a boat
ashore, which returned with a letter addressed ostensibly
to Sir James Yeo, of the British frigate Southampton;
but between the lines, written in sympathetic
ink, Porter found a message from Bainbridge,
directing him to cruise off Rio and wait for the Constitution.
On the 29th of December he was in the
prescribed station, and cruised in the neighborhood
for some days, although he knew a British ship-of-the-line,
the Montagu, was lying in Rio; but only
one British prize was taken, the merchant vessels of
that nation usually waiting in port until they could
sail under convoy of a ship-of-war. Attempting to
get to windward in a heavy sea, the Essex was
much racked and injured some of her spars, and her
captain therefore decided to bear away for refit to
St. Catherine's&mdash;a port five hundred miles south of
Rio Janeiro, which had been named in his instructions
as a contingent rendezvous. On the 20th of
January, 1813, the Essex anchored there, and began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the work of refitting and filling with water and
fresh provisions. A few days after her arrival a
small Portuguese vessel came in, bringing an account
of the capture by the Montagu of an American corvette,
which Porter supposed to be the Hornet, as
well as a rumor of the action between the Constitution
and the Java, and a report that re-enforcements
were reaching the British naval force on the station.
The history of past wars convinced Porter that the
neutrality of the Portuguese port in which he was
lying would not be respected by the enemy. In
a very few days his presence there must become
known; any junction with his consorts was rendered
most unlikely by the news just received, and he determined
at once to undertake alone the mission for
which the three ships had been dispatched. With
admirable promptitude, both of decision and action,
the Essex sailed the same night for the Pacific.</p>

<p>From the time of leaving the United States the
crew of the ship had been restricted to that close
and economical allowance of provisions and water
which was necessary to a vessel whose home ports
were blocked by enemy's cruisers, and which in every
quarter of the globe might expect to meet the fleets
and influence of a powerful foe. The passage round
Cape Horn, always stormy, was both a long and severe
strain to a vessel bound from east to west, and
dependent wholly upon sail; for the winds prevail
from the westward. The utmost prudence was required
in portioning out both food and water, and
of bread there remained, on leaving St. Catherine's,
only enough for three months at half allowance&mdash;that
is, at half a pound per day. The boy Farragut
thus found himself, at the outset of his career, ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>posed
to one of the severest tests of his arduous
calling&mdash;a long and stormy passage, made in the
teeth of violent gales, and with a crew reduced to
the scantiest possible allowance of food, under conditions
when the system most demands support. In
his journal he speaks, as Porter does in his, of the
severe suffering and dreadful weather experienced.
For twenty-one days the Essex struggled with the
furious blasts, the heavy seas, and the bitter weather,
which have made the passage round Cape Horn proverbial
for hardship among seamen. On the 3d of
March, he writes, a sea was shipped which burst in,
on one side of the ship and from one end to the
other, all the ports through which the guns are fired,
and which, for such a passage, are closed and securely
fastened. One boat on the weather side was
driven in on deck, and that on the opposite carried
overboard; but with great difficulty the latter was
saved. Large quantities of water rushed below, leading
those there to imagine that the ship was sinking.
"This was the only instance in which I ever saw a real
good seaman paralyzed by fear at the dangers of the
sea. Several of the sailors were seen on their knees
at prayer; but most were found ready to do their
duty. They were called on deck, and came promptly,
led by William Kingsbury, the boatswain's mate.
Long shall I remember the cheering sound of his
stentorian voice, which resembled the roaring of a
lion rather than that of a human being, when he told
them: 'D&mdash;n their eyes, to put their best foot forward,
as there was one side of the ship left yet.'"</p>

<p>Cape Horn, however, was at last passed and
enough ground gained to the westward to allow the
Essex again to head north. On the 11th of March<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
she was off the city of Valparaiso, in Chile. As far
as Porter then knew, Chile was still a province of
Spain, and Spain was the ally of Great Britain; whose
armies for four years past had been engaged in war
in the Peninsula, to shake from it the grip of Napoleon.
There had been trouble also between Spain
and the United States about the Floridas. The first
lieutenant of the Essex was therefore first sent
ashore to see what reception would be given, and
returned with the satisfactory intelligence that Chile
was in revolution against the mother country, and was
ready heartily to welcome a ship-of-war belonging
to the American Republic. He also brought the
news that the Viceroy of Spain in Peru had fitted
out privateers against Chilian commerce; and that
these, on the plea of being allies of Great Britain,
had begun to capture American whalers. It seemed,
therefore, that the Essex had arrived as opportunely
for the protection of United States interests as for
the injury of British commerce.</p>

<p>Several days were lost in these preliminaries, so
that it was not till the 15th that the anchor was
dropped in Valparaiso. Despite the cordial reception
given, Porter was in haste to reach his scene of action
in the North and sailed again on the 22d. Four
days later he met a Peruvian privateer, the Nereyda,
the captain of which was deceived by the Essex
hoisting British colors. Coming on board the frigate,
he stated freely that the Spaniards considered themselves
the allies of Great Britain, that he was himself
cruising for American whalers, and had on board
at the moment the crews of two of these which he
had taken. Having extracted all the information he
wanted, Porter undeceived the privateersman, took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
possession of the ship, threw overboard her guns and
ammunition, and then released her, with a letter to
the Viceroy; which, backed by the presence of the
Essex, was calculated to insure peaceable treatment
to American vessels.</p>

<p>There were at this time on the coast of Peru and
in the neighboring waters twenty-three American
whalers, worth, with their cargoes, two and a half
million dollars, and mostly unarmed, having left
home in a time of peace. Of English ships there
were twenty; but, their country having been long
at war, these were generally armed, and in many
cases provided with letters of marque authorizing
them to act as privateers and capture vessels hostile
to their Crown. In this state of things, so unpromising
for American interests, the arrival of the Essex
entirely turned the scales, besides stopping the Spanish
depredations which had but just begun.</p>

<p>On the 27th of March, off the harbor of Callao,
the port of Lima, Porter recaptured the Barclay, one
of the American ships seized by the Nereyda; but,
although the frigate again disguised her nationality
by hoisting British colors, there was among the several
vessels in the harbor only one that showed the
same flag. With the Barclay in company, the Essex
now stood away for the Galapagos Islands. These
are a group situated just south of the equator and
some five hundred miles from the South American
coast. Uninhabited then, as for the most part they
still are, they were in 1813 a favorite rendezvous for
British whalers, who had established upon one of the
islands (Charles) a means of communication by a box
nailed to a tree, which was called the post-office.
They abound in turtle, some of which weigh several<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hundred pounds, and form a very valuable as well as
acceptable change of diet to seamen long confined to
salt food. On the 17th of April the Essex came in
sight of Chatham Island, one of the largest, and remained
cruising in the neighborhood of the group
till the beginning of June, when want of water compelled
her to go to Tumbez, a port on the continent
just abreast of the Galapagos. In this period seven
British whalers were taken; so that on the 24th of
June there were anchored in Tumbez Bay, including
the frigate and the Barclay, nine vessels under Porter's
command. Of these, he commissioned one&mdash;the
fastest and best, somewhat less than half the
size of the Essex herself&mdash;as a United States cruiser,
under his command. She was named the Essex
Junior, carried twenty guns, of which half were long
six-pounders and half eighteen-pounder carronades,
and was manned by sixty of the Essex's crew under
her first lieutenant.</p>

<p>The first service of the Essex Junior was to convoy
to Valparaiso the Barclay and four of the British
prizes. The occasion was one of great importance
and interest to Farragut; for, though but a boy of
twelve, he was selected to command the party of seamen
detailed to manage the Barclay during this long
passage. The captain of the Barclay went with his
ship, but in great discontent that the command of
the seamen was given not to himself, but to such a
lad from the ship-of-war. Being a violent-tempered
old man, he attempted by bluster to overawe the boy
into surrendering his authority. "When the day
arrived for our separation from the squadron,"
writes Farragut in his journal, "the captain was
furious, and very plainly intimated to me that I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
would 'find myself off New Zealand in the morning,'
to which I most decidedly demurred. We were lying
still, while the other ships were fast disappearing
from view, the commodore going north and the
Essex Junior, with her convoy, steering to the south
for Valparaiso. I considered that my day of trial
had arrived (for I was a little afraid of the old fellow,
as every one else was). But the time had come
for me at least to play the man; so I mustered up
courage and informed the captain that I desired the
maintopsail filled away, in order that we might close
up with the Essex Junior. He replied that he would
shoot any man who dared to touch a rope without
his orders; he 'would go his own course, and had no
idea of trusting himself with a d&mdash;d nutshell'; and
then he went below for his pistols. I called my right-hand
man of the crew and told him my situation. I
also informed him that I wanted the maintopsail
filled. He answered with a clear 'Ay, ay, sir!' in
a manner which was not to be misunderstood, and
my confidence was perfectly restored. From that
moment I became master of the vessel, and immediately
gave all necessary orders for making sail,
notifying the captain not to come on deck with his
pistols unless he wished to go overboard, for I
would really have had very little trouble in having
such an order obeyed. I made my report to Captain
Downes (of the Essex Junior), on rejoining him; and
the captain also told his story, in which he endeavored
to pursuade Downes that he only tried to frighten
me. I replied by requesting Captain Downes to
ask him how he succeeded; and to show him that I
did not fear him, I offered to go back and proceed
with him to Valparaiso. He was informed that I was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
in command, he being simply my adviser in navigating
the vessel in case of separation. So, this being
settled and understood, I returned to the Barclay,
and everything went on amicably up to our arrival
in Valparaiso."</p>

<p>It was on the 30th of June that the little squadron
sailed from Tumbez, standing to the westward
till they should reach the trade-winds; and on the
4th of July that the Essex Junior separated, with the
prizes, and Farragut had his scene with the captain
of the Barclay. As the winds on the west coast of
South America blow throughout the year from the
southward, the passage of sailing vessels in that direction
is always long; but for the same reason the
return is quickly made. When, therefore, the Essex
Junior rejoined the Essex at the Galapagos, on the
30th of September, she brought comparatively recent
news, and that of a very important character. Letters
from the American consul in Buenos Ayres informed
Porter that on the 5th of July the British
frigate Ph&oelig;be, of thirty-six guns, a vessel in every
way of superior force to the Essex, had sailed from
Rio Janeiro for the Pacific, accompanied by two
sloops-of-war, the Cherub and Raccoon, of twenty-four
guns each. This little squadron was charged
with the double mission of checking the ravages of
the Essex and of destroying the fur trade of American
citizens at the mouth of the Columbia River.
From the date of their leaving Rio these ships were
not improbably now on the coast; and allowing for
time to refit after the stormy passage round the Horn,
they might be expected soon to seek Porter at the
Galapagos, the headquarters of the British whalers.</p>

<p>The Essex Junior brought back the prize-crews<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
and prize-masters who had navigated the captured
ships to Valparaiso, and with the others Farragut
now rejoined the frigate. During their absence Porter
had taken four more valuable vessels. According
to his information, there remained but one uncaptured
of the British whalers which centered around
the islands. The Essex had taken eleven; and
among these, six carried letters of marque from their
Government, authorizing them to seize for their own
profit vessels of a nation at war with Great Britain.
These powers would doubtless have been exercised
at the expense of the unprepared American whalers
but for the opportune appearance of the Essex,
which had also released the vessels of her country
from the ports to which, at the time of her arrival,
they had been driven by Peruvian privateers. Porter's
work in this region was therefore finished. He
had entirely broken up an important branch of British
commerce, inflicting damage estimated at nearly
three million dollars; but the coming of an enemy's
force considerably superior to his own, an event
wholly beyond his control, reversed all the conditions
and imposed upon him some new line of action. For
this he was already prepared, and he took his decision
with the promptitude characteristic of the man. The
commander of the British squadron, Captain Hillyar,
was personally well known to him, being an old
acquaintance in the Mediterranean; and he doubtless
realized from observation, as well as from his past
record, that his enemy was not a man to throw away,
through any carelessness or false feeling of chivalry,
a single advantage conferred by his superior force.
On the other hand, Porter himself was not one quietly
to submit to superiority without an effort to regain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the control which the chances of naval war might
yet throw into his hands. He was determined to
fight, if any fair chance offered; but to do so it was
necessary to put his ship in the highest state of efficiency,
which could only be done by leaving the spot
where he was known to be, and, throwing the enemy
off his scent, repairing to one where the necessary
work could be performed in security. Two days
after the arrival of the Essex Junior all the vessels
sailed from the Galapagos Islands for the Marquesas.
On the 25th of October they anchored at one of this
group, called Nukahiva Island.</p>

<p>During the six weeks the Essex lay at this
anchorage her crew bore a part in several expeditions
on shore, designed to protect the natives in the
neighborhood against hostile tribes in other parts of
the island. In this land fighting Farragut and his
younger messmates were not allowed to share; but
were, on the contrary, compelled to attend a school
established on board of one of the prizes, with the
ship's chaplain for school-master. They were, however,
permitted out of school hours and after the
day's work, which for the ship's company ended at
4 <span class="smcap">p.&nbsp;m.</span>, to ramble freely in the island among the
natives; considerable liberty being allowed to all
hands, who, during their year's absence from the
United States, had had little opportunity to visit any
inhabited places. Farragut here learned to swim, and
the aptitude of the natives to the water seems to
have impressed him more than their other peculiarities
which have since then been so liberally described
in books of travel. "It appears as natural," he
wrote, "for these islanders to swim as to eat. I have
often seen mothers take their little children, appar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>ently
not more than two years old, down to the sea
on their backs, walk deliberately into deep water, and
leave them to paddle for themselves. To my astonishment,
the little creatures could swim like young
ducks."</p>

<p>On the 9th of December, 1813, the Essex and
Essex Junior sailed for Valparaiso with one of the
prizes, leaving the others at the Marquesas. Nothing
of interest occurred during the passage, but the
crew were daily exercised at all the arms carried by
the ship&mdash;with the cannon, the muskets, and the
single-sticks. The latter are for training in the use
of the broadsword or cutlass, the play with which
would be too dangerous for ordinary drills. Porter
had a strong disposition to resort to boarding and
hand-to-hand fighting, believing that the very surprise
of an attack by the weaker party would go far
to compensate for the inequality of numbers. On
more than one occasion already, in the presence of
superior force, he had contemplated resorting to
this desperate game; and to a ship the character of
whose battery necessitated a close approach to the
enemy, the power to throw on board, at a moment's
notice, a body of thoroughly drilled and equipped
swordsmen was unquestionably of the first importance.
"I have never since been in a ship," said
Farragut at a later day, "where the crew of the old
Essex was represented, but that I found them to be
the best swordsmen on board. They had been so
thoroughly trained as boarders that every man was
prepared for such an emergency, with his cutlass as
sharp as a razor, a dirk made from a file by the
ship's armorer, and a pistol." With a ship well refitted
and with a crew thus perfectly drilled, Porter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
had done all that in him lay in the way of preparation
for victory. If he did not win, he would at least
deserve to do so. For Farragut it is interesting to
notice that, in his tender youth and most impressible
years, he had before him, both in his captain and in
his ship, most admirable models. The former daring
to recklessness, yet leaving nothing to chance; fearless
of responsibility, but ever sagacious in its exercise;
a rigid disciplinarian, who yet tempered rigor
by a profound knowledge of and sympathy with the
peculiarities of the men who were under him. The
latter&mdash;the ship&mdash;became, as ships under strong captains
tend to become, the embodiment of the commander's
spirit. Thoroughly prepared and armed
at all points, she was now advancing at the close of
her career to an audacious encounter with a greatly
superior force. Whether the enterprise was justifiable
or not, at least nothing that care could do to
insure success was left to chance or to favor. Porter
might perhaps have quitted the Pacific in December,
1813, and, reaching the United States coast in
the winter, have escaped the blockade which at that
season was necessarily relaxed. By doing so he
might have saved his ship; but the United States
Navy would have lost one of the most brilliant pages
in its history, and its future admiral one of the most
glorious episodes in his own great career.</p>

<p>On the 12th of January, 1814, the Essex arrived off
the coast of Chile, making the land well to the southward&mdash;that
is, to windward&mdash;of Valparaiso. From
this point of arrival she ran slowly to the northward,
looking into the old town of <a name="Page_31t" id="Page_31t"></a><a href="#Page_31tn">Concepción</a>, between two
and three hundred miles from Valparaiso. In the
latter port she anchored on the 3d of February. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
ordinary salutes and civilities with the authorities having
been exchanged, every effort was made to get the
ship ready for sea, the Essex Junior being employed
cruising off the port so as to give timely notice of
the approach of an enemy; a precaution necessary
at all times, even in a neutral port, but especially so
at a period when neutral rights were being openly
disregarded in every direction by both the great
belligerents, France and Great Britain. Moreover,
Captain Hillyar, though a brave and experienced
officer, a favorite with Nelson, whose esteem could
not be won without high professional merit, was
reputed to have shown scanty scruples about neutral
rights on a previous occasion, when the disregard of
them procured an advantage to the enterprise he had
in hand. Being sent with several armed boats to attack
two Spanish corvettes lying in the port of Barcelona,
in the year 1800, he had pulled alongside a
neutral vessel, a Swede, which was standing into the
harbor; and after examining her papers in the due
exercise of his right as a belligerent, his boats
hooked on to her, thus using a neutral to tow them
into the enemy's port, so that his men reached their
scene of exertion unfatigued by the oar, and for a
great part of the way protected by such respect as
the Spanish batteries might show to a neutral coerced
into aiding a hostile undertaking. "Having approached
within about three quarters of a mile of the
nearest battery," says the British naval historian
James, "and being reminded by two shots which
passed over the galliot that it was time to retire
from the shelter of a neutral vessel, Captain Hillyar
pulled away." Both the Spanish and Swedish Governments
complained of this act, and their complaints<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
delayed the promotion which Hillyar's gallantry
would otherwise have won. Whatever the strict propriety
of his conduct in this case, it was sufficiently
doubtful to excite a just suspicion that Hillyar
would not be deterred, by over-delicacy about the
neutrality of the port, from seizing any advantage
offered him by the unwariness of his enemy; and
so the event proved.</p>

<p>On the 7th of February a dance was given on
board the Essex, which lasted till midnight. In order
that her officers might share in the entertainment,
the Essex Junior was allowed to anchor,
though in a position to have a clear view of the sea;
but, when the guests began to depart, her commander
went on board and got under way to resume his station
outside. Before the decorations of the ball-room
had been taken down, a signal was made from
her that two enemy's ships were in sight. A whole
watch&mdash;one third of the Essex's crew&mdash;were then on
shore, but were quickly recalled by a gun. The ship
was at once cleared for action, and the men at their
quarters, with all the rapidity to be expected from
the careful drilling they had had during their long
commission. Porter himself had gone to the lookout
ship to reconnoitre the enemy. Upon his return he
found the frigate all ready for battle, it being then
just an hour and a half since the alarm was given.
The Essex Junior was then anchored in a position to
support the Essex should occasion arise.</p>

<p>The strangers were the Ph&oelig;be and the Cherub.
The third British ship, the Raccoon, had gone north
to the Columbia. As has before been said, Captain
Hillyar was an old friend of Porter's. The two men
had been thrown together in the Mediterranean, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the American had been a frequent visitor in the
other's house at Gibraltar. On one occasion Hillyar's
family had made a passage from Malta to Gibraltar
in an American ship-of-war; for in those
troubled times would-be voyagers had to avail
themselves of such opportunities as offered, and the
courtesy of a large armed ship was among the most
favorable. It was natural, therefore, that, as the
Ph&oelig;be stood into the harbor, Captain Hillyar should
bring his ship, the wind allowing it, close to the Essex
and hail the latter with a polite inquiry after
Captain Porter's health; but it was going rather
too far, under all the circumstances, not to be content
with passing slowly under the Essex's stern, than
which no more favorable position could be found for
an exchange of civil words. Instead of so doing, the
helm of the Ph&oelig;be was put down and the ship luffed
up into the wind between the Essex and the Essex
Junior, the latter lying now near the senior ship and
on her starboard beam. Whether Hillyar counted
upon his own seamanship to extricate his ship from
the awkward position in which he had placed her, or
whether, as the Americans believed, he intended to
attack if circumstances favored, he soon saw that he
had exposed himself to extreme peril. As the Ph&oelig;be
lost her way she naturally fell off from the wind, her
bows being swept round toward the Essex, while her
stern was presented to the Essex Junior. Both her
enemies had their guns trained on her; she could
use none of hers. At the same time, in the act of
falling off, she approached the Essex; and her jib-boom,
projecting far beyond her bows, swept over
the forecastle of the latter. Porter, who had been
watching the whole proceeding with great distrust,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
had summoned his boarders as soon as the Ph&oelig;be
luffed. The Essex at the moment was in a state of
as absolute preparation as is a musket at full cock
trained on the mark, and with the marksman's eye
ranging over the sights; every man at his post, every
gun trained, matches burning, and boarders standing
by. The position was one of extreme tension. The
American captain had in his hand a chance such as
in his most sanguine dreams he could scarcely have
hoped. His guns, feeble at a distance, could tell
with the greatest effect at such short range; and even
if his enemy dropped an anchor, in the great depths
of Valparaiso Bay he would not fetch up till far past
the Essex. Until then he was for the moment helpless.
Porter hailed that if the ships touched he should
at once attack. Hillyar kept his presence of mind
admirably at this critical juncture, replying in an indifferent
manner that he had no intention of allowing
the Ph&oelig;be to fall on board the Essex&mdash;an assurance
that was well enough, and, coupled with his
nonchalant manner, served the purpose of keeping
Porter in doubt as to whether a breach of neutrality
had been intended. But the British frigate was unquestionably
in a position where a seaman should
not have placed her unless he meant mischief. It is
good luck, not good management, when a ship in
the Ph&oelig;be's position does not foul one in that of the
Essex. While this was passing, Farragut was witness
to a circumstance which shows by what a feather's
weight scales are sometimes turned. Of all the
watch that had been on shore when the enemy appeared,
he says, one only, a mere boy, returned
under the influence of liquor. "When the Ph&oelig;be
was close alongside, and all hands at quarters, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
powder-boys stationed with slow matches ready to
discharge the guns, the boarders, cutlass in hand,
standing by to board in the smoke, as was our custom
at close quarters, the intoxicated youth saw, or
imagined that he saw, through the port, some one
on the Ph&oelig;be grinning at him. 'My fine fellow, I'll
stop your making faces,' he exclaimed, and was just
about to fire his gun, when Lieutenant McKnight saw
the movement and with a blow sprawled him on the
deck. Had that gun been fired, I am convinced that
the Ph&oelig;be would have been ours." She probably
would, for the Essex could have got in three broadsides
of her twenty thirty-two-pounder carronades
before the enemy could effectively reply, a beginning
which would have reversed the odds between the
two ships. Farragut fully shared the belief of all
his shipmates that an attack was intended, in consequence
of the information given to Captain Hillyar,
as he was entering, by the boat of an English
merchant ship in the port, that half the crew of
the Essex was on shore. As the Ph&oelig;be luffed
through between the two Americans a turn of her
helm would have landed her on the bows of the
Essex, if the latter had been caught at disadvantage.
Instead of this, she was found fully prepared. The
Essex Junior was also on the spot, while the Cherub,
having drifted half a mile to leeward, could not have
taken any part till the action was decided. Under
these conditions, although their force was inferior,
the advantage was with the Americans, whose ships
were anchored and cleared, while the Ph&oelig;be still
had her canvas spread and the anchoring to do,
which is a troublesome operation in water so deep as
that of Valparaiso Bay. If men's motives can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
judged by their acts, Captain Hillyar afforded Porter
full justification for opening fire. He extricated
himself from a false position with consummate coolness;
but his adversary, when taken later at disadvantage,
had reason to regret the generosity with
which he allowed him the benefit of the doubt as to
his intentions to respect the neutrality of the port.
As it was, when the two ships were almost touching,
the Englishman threw his sails to the mast, and, backing
clear of the Essex, anchored finally some distance
astern.</p>

<p>The two British ships remained in port for a few
days, during which their captains called upon Captain
Porter on shore, where he was then living in the
house of a gentleman named Blanco; and an amicable
intercourse also grew up between the officers and
crews of the two parties. Hillyar, however, told
Porter frankly that he should not throw away the
advantage given by his superior force, for the event
of a naval action was ever uncertain, liable to be
decided by the accidental loss of an important spar
or rope; whereas, by keeping his two ships together,
he thought he could effectually blockade the Essex
and prevent her renewing her depredations upon
British commerce until the arrival of other ships of
war which were on their way. From this wary attitude
Porter in vain tried to force his antagonist by
varied provocations; but, although the exchange of
official insults, verging closely at times upon personal
imputations, caused bitterness to take the place
of the first friendly courtesies, Hillyar was too old
an officer, and his reputation for courage too well
known, to allow his hand to be thus forced.</p>

<p>After filling with provisions and refitting, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
British ships left the anchorage and cruised off the
approach to it, thus preventing the retreat of the
Essex to the ocean, unless she could succeed in passing
and then outsailing them. Valparaiso Bay is not
an enclosed harbor, but simply a recess in the coast,
which, running generally north and south, here turns
abruptly to the eastward for two or three miles and
then trends north again, leaving thus a concave
beach facing the north. Along this beach lies the
city of Valparaiso, stretching back and up on the
hillsides, which rise to a height of twelve or fifteen
hundred feet behind it. The prevailing winds along
this coast being from the southward throughout the
year, this formation gives an anchorage sheltered
from them; but during the winter months of the
southern hemisphere, from May to October, there
are occasional northerly gales which endanger shipping,
more from the heavy sea that rolls in than
from the violence of the wind. In ordinary weather,
at the season when the Essex was thus blockaded,
the harbor is quiet through the night until the forenoon,
when the southerly wind prevailing outside
works its way in to the anchorage and blows freshly
till after sundown. At times it descends in furious
gusts down the ravines which cleave the hillsides,
covering the city with clouds of dust and whirling
sand and pebbles painfully in the faces of those who
walk the streets.</p>

<p>On the 28th of March, 1814, such a blast descended
upon the Essex, whose captain had by that time
come to despair of forcing Hillyar to single combat.
As the frigate straightened out her cables under the
force of the wind, one of them broke, and the anchor
of the other lost its hold upon the bottom. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Essex began to drift to sea, and it was apparent
would by this accident be carried out of reach of
the port. Porter therefore ordered the cable cut
and made sail on the ship, intending now to escape.
The British ships kept habitually close to the western
point of the bay; so that in case of such an attempt
by their enemy he would have to pass to leeward
of them, giving them a fair wind to follow. As
Porter stood out, however, he thought possible, by
keeping close to the wind, to pass to windward,
which, with the superior sailing qualities of the
Essex, would force the Ph&oelig;be to separate from the
Cherub, unless Hillyar supinely acquiesced in his escape&mdash;an
inadmissible supposition. If successful, he
might yet have the single action he desired, and under
conditions which would enable him to choose his
distance and so profit by the qualities of his carronades.
The Essex therefore hugged the wind; but
as she was thus passing the western point of the
bay, under a press of sail, a violent squall came
down from the highland above, bearing the vessel
over on her side and carrying away the maintopmast,
which fell into the sea, drowning several of the
crew. The loss of so important a part of her sail
power made escape to sea impossible, and the Essex
tried to regain the port. The wind, however, was
adverse to the attempt in her crippled condition, so
that she was only able to reach the east side of the
bay, where she anchored about three miles from
the city, but within pistol-shot of the shore, before
the enemy could overtake her. As the conventional
neutral line extends three miles from the beach, the
Essex was here clearly under the protection of Chilian
neutrality. Hillyar himself, in his official report<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
of the action, says she was "so near the shore as to
preclude the possibility of passing ahead of her without
risk to His Majesty's ships." He seems, however,
to have satisfied his conscience by drawing a
line between the neutrality of the port and the neutrality
of the country. The Essex was, he implies,
outside the former. "Not succeeding in gaining
the limits of the part, she bore up and anchored near
the shore, a few miles to leeward of it."<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> At all
events, having his adversary at such serious disadvantage,
he did not propose to imitate the weakness
Porter had shown toward himself six weeks before.</p>

<p>The crucial feature in the approaching action
was that the Essex was armed almost entirely with
carronades, and her principal enemy with long guns.
The carronade, now a wholly obsolete arm, was a
short cannon, made extremely light in proportion to
the weight of the ball thrown by it. The comparative
lightness of metal in each piece allowed a
greater number to be carried, but at the same time
so weakened the gun as to compel the use of a small
charge of powder, in consequence of which the ball
moved slowly and had but short range. In compensation,
within its range, it broke up the hull of an
enemy's ship more completely than the smaller but
swifter ball from a long gun of the same weight;
for the same reason that a stone thrown by hand demolishes
a pane of glass, while a pistol-bullet makes
a small, clean hole. It was this smashing effect at
close quarters which gave the carronade favor in
the eyes of one generation of seamen; but by 1812
it was generally recognized that, unless a vessel was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
able to choose her own position, the short range of
carronades might leave her helpless, and, even when
she had the greater speed, an enemy with long guns
might cripple her as she approached. Porter had
begged to change his carronades for long guns when
he joined the Essex. The request was refused, and
the ship in this action had forty thirty-two-pounder
carronades and six long twelve-pounders. The
Ph&oelig;be had twenty-six long eighteen-pounders, one
long twelve, and one long nine, besides eight carronades.
The Essex being crippled and at anchor, Captain
Hillyar, faithful, and most properly, to his principle
of surrendering no advantage, chose his position
beyond effective carronade range. The battle
was therefore fought between the six long twelves
of the Essex and the broadside of the Ph&oelig;be, consisting
of thirteen long eighteens, one twelve, and
one nine. Taking no account of the Cherub, the disparity
of force is sufficiently obvious.</p>

<p>Although, from the assurances Hillyar had made
to him in conversation, Porter had hoped that the
neutrality of the port might be regarded, the manner
in which the enemy's vessels approached his new anchorage
gave serious reason to fear an attack. The
ship was again got ready for action, and a spring put
on the cable to enable the guns to be turned on the
enemy in any position he might take. The desperateness
of the situation was, however, manifest to
all. "I well remember," wrote Farragut at a later
day, "the feelings of awe produced in me by the
approach of the hostile ships; even to my young
mind it was perceptible in the faces of those around
me, as clearly as possible, that our case was hopeless.
It was equally apparent that all were ready to die at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
their guns rather than surrender; and such I believe
to have been the determination of the crew, almost
to a man." A crippled ship, armed with carronades,
was indeed in a hopeless plight. At six minutes before
four in the afternoon the attack began. The
Essex riding to an anchor with a southerly wind, the
Cherub took position on her starboard bow, or southwest
from her; the Ph&oelig;be north, under her stern.
Both British ships began fighting under sail, not
being yet ready to anchor. The spring on the
Essex's cable being shot away, she was unable to
turn her broadside as was wished; but the Americans
ran out of the stern-ports three of their long
guns, which were so well served as to cut away some
of the most important of the Ph&oelig;be's ropes and sails,
and Hillyar for a moment feared his ship would be
drifted out of action. The Cherub also was forced
to leave her first position and join the Ph&oelig;be. The
latter's damages being repaired, she regained her
ground and anchored; both she and her consort
placing themselves on the starboard quarter of the
Essex, a position on which the American guns, neither
from the stern nor the broadside, could be brought to
bear unless by the springs on the cables. These, unfortunately,
were three times shot away as soon as
they had been placed. The first lieutenant of the
Ph&oelig;be, a frank and gallant young Englishman,
whose manly bearing had greatly attracted the officers
of the Essex, is said to have remarked to his
captain that it was no better than murder to go on
killing men from such a position of safety, and to
have urged him to close and make a more equal fight
of it. Hillyar, so the story goes, replied that his
reputation was established, and that as his orders<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
were peremptory to capture the Essex, he was determined
to take no risks. He might have added&mdash;probably
did&mdash;that it was open to the Americans to save
their lives by surrendering. The same view of the
situation now impelled Porter, finding himself unable
to give blow for blow, to try and close with his wary
enemy. Only one light sail was left to him in condition
for setting&mdash;the flying-jib. With it, the cable
having been cut, the head of the Essex was turned
toward the enemy; and, fanned along by the other
sails hanging loose from the yards, she slowly approached
her foes till her carronades at last could
reach. The wary Englishman then slipped his cable
and stood away till again out of range, when he resumed
the action, choosing always his own position,
which he was well able to do from the comparatively
manageable condition of his ship. Finding it impossible
to get into action, Porter next attempted to
run the Essex aground, where the crew could escape
and the vessel be destroyed. She was headed for
the beach and approached within musket-shot of it,
when a flaw of wind from the land cruelly turned her
away.</p>

<p>The engagement had lasted nearly two hours
when this disappointment was encountered. As a
last resort, Porter now ordered a hawser to be made
fast to an anchor which was still left. This was let
go in the hope that, the Essex being held by it
where she was, the enemy might drift out of action
and be unable to return when the wind fell with the
approaching sunset. The hawser, however, parted,
and with it the last hope of escape. Great numbers
of the crew had already been killed and wounded by
the relentless pounding the ship had received from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
her enemies, for whom, toward the end, the affair
became little more than safe target practice, with a
smooth sea. As yet no voice had been raised in
favor of submission; but now entreaty was made to
Porter to spare the lives of the remnant that was left,
by ceasing a resistance which had become not only
hopeless but passive, and which, however prolonged,
could end only in the surrender of the ship. The latter
had already been on fire several times, and was
now alarmingly so, the flames rushing up the hatchways
and being reported to be near the magazine.
Porter then gave permission for such of the crew as
wished, to swim ashore; the colors being still flying,
they were not yet prisoners of war. He next called
his officers together to inform him as to the condition
of the ship in the different parts where they served,
but one only of the lieutenants was able to answer
the summons. After consultation with him, satisfied
that nothing more remained to be done, the order
was given at twenty minutes past six to lower the
flag of the Essex, after an action which had lasted
two hours and a half. She had gone into battle with
two hundred and fifty-five men. Of these, fifty-eight
were killed, sixty-six wounded, and thirty-one missing.
The last item is unusually large for a naval action,
and was probably due to the attempt to escape
to shore by swimming.</p>

<p>Farragut lacked still three months of being thirteen
years old when he passed through this tremendous
ordeal of slaughter, the most prolonged and the
bloodiest of his distinguished career. At his tender
years and in his subordinate position there could be,
of course, no demand upon the professional ability
or the moral courage which grapples with responsi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>bility,
of which he gave such high proof in his later
life. In the Essex fight his was but to do and dare,
perhaps it may rather be said to do and bear; for
no heavier strain can be laid upon the physical courage
than is required by passive endurance of a deadly
attack without the power of reply. In the celebrated
charge of the Six Hundred at Balaklava the
magnificent display of courage was at least aided by
the opportunity allowed for vehement action; the
extreme nervous tension excited by such deadly
danger found an outlet in the mad impetus of the
forward rush. Farragut has himself recorded a singular
instance in the Essex fight, which illustrates the
sufficiently well-known fact that in the excitement
of approaching action the sense of danger is subdued,
even in a man who has not the strong nerves
that endure the passive expectation of death. "On
one occasion Midshipman Isaacs came up to the
captain and reported that a quarter-gunner named
Roach had deserted his post. The only reply of the
captain, addressed to me, was: 'Do your duty, sir!'
I seized a pistol and went in pursuit of the fellow,
but did not find him. It appeared subsequently
that when the ship was reported to be on fire he had
contrived to get into the only boat that could be
kept afloat, and escaped, with six others, to the shore.
The most remarkable part of this affair was that
Roach had always been a leading man in the ship,
and on the occasion previously mentioned, when the
Ph&oelig;be seemed about to run into us in the harbor of
Valparaiso and the boarders were called away, I
distinctly remember this man standing in an exposed
position on the cat-head, with sleeves rolled up and
cutlass in hand, ready to board, his countenance ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>pressing
eagerness for the fight; which goes to
prove that personal courage is a very peculiar virtue."</p>

<p>Of his own courage the boy, in this his first action,
gave the most marked proof. He was constantly
under the captain's eye, and conducted himself
so entirely to the satisfaction of that gallant
officer as to be mentioned particularly in the dispatches.
"Midshipmen Isaacs, Farragut, and Ogden
exerted themselves in the performance of their respective
duties, and gave an earnest of their value to
the service." "They are too young," Porter added,
"to recommend for promotion"&mdash;a phrase which
Farragut thought had an ill-effect on his career, but
which certainly implied that his conduct merited a
reward that his years did not justify. During the
action he was employed in the most multifarious
ways, realizing the saying that whatever is nobody
else's business is a midshipman's business; or, to use
his own quaint expression, "I was like 'Paddy in
the catharpins'&mdash;a man on occasions. I performed
the duties of captain's aid, quarter-gunner, powder-boy,
and, in fact, did everything that was required of
me. I shall never forget the horrid impression made
upon me at the sight of the first man I had ever
seen killed. He was a boatswain's mate and was
fearfully mutilated. It staggered and sickened me
at first; but they soon began to fall around me so
fast that it all appeared like a dream and produced
no effect upon my nerves. I can remember well,
while I was standing near the captain just abaft of
the mainmast, a shot came through the waterways
and glanced upward, killing four men who were
standing by the side of the gun, taking the last one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
in the head and scattering his brains over both of us.
But this awful sight did not affect me half as much
as the death of the first poor fellow. I neither
thought of nor noticed anything but the working of
the guns.... When my services were not required
for other purposes, I generally assisted in working a
gun; would run and bring powder from the boys and
send them back for more, until the captain wanted
me to carry a message; and this continued to employ
me during the action."</p>

<p>Although included in the report of the slightly
wounded, Farragut received no serious injury, but
he was not without the narrow escapes which must
have been undergone by all the survivors of so desperate
an action. One has just been related; and he
has himself recorded two other incidents which came
near making an end of him. "An old quartermaster
named Francis Bland was standing at the wheel when
I saw a shot coming over the fore yard in such a direction
that I thought it would strike him or me; so
I told him to jump, at the same time pulling him toward
me. At that instant the shot took off his right
leg, and I afterward found that my coat-tail had been
carried away. I helped the old fellow below, and
inquired for him after the action, but he had died
before he could be attended to." At another time
"some gun-primers were wanted and I was sent after
them. In going below, while I was on the ward-room
ladder, the captain of the gun directly opposite the
hatchway was struck full in the face by an eighteen-pound
shot and fell back on me; we tumbled down
the hatch together. I struck on my head, and, fortunately,
he fell on my hips. I say fortunately, for,
as he was a man of at least two hundred pounds'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
weight, I would have been crushed to death if he had
fallen directly across my body. I lay for some moments
stunned by the blow, but soon recovered consciousness
enough to rush on deck. The captain, seeing
me covered with blood, asked if I were wounded,
to which I replied: 'I believe not, sir.' 'Then,'
said he, 'where are the primers?' This brought me
completely to my senses, and I ran below and carried
the primers on deck. When I came up the second
time I saw the captain fall, and in my turn ran up
and asked if he were wounded. He answered me almost
in the same words: 'I believe not, my son; but
I felt a blow on the top of my head.' He must have
been knocked down by the wind of a passing shot, as
his hat was somewhat damaged." The bruises from
this fall down the hatch were the only injuries Farragut
received.</p>

<p>When the surrender was determined, Farragut, at
the captain's order, dropped the signal book overboard,
watching it as it sank in the water till out of
sight; and then in company with another midshipman
amused himself throwing overboard the pistols and
other small arms, to keep them out of the enemy's
hands. The following morning he went on board
the Ph&oelig;be, where the mortification of defeat drew
tears from his eyes; a state of dejection from which
he was roused by seeing a pet pig belonging to the
Essex in the custody of one of the Ph&oelig;be's midshipmen.
Farragut at once set up a claim to the porker
as being private property, and as such to be respected
by all civilized nations. The claim was resisted
by the new owner; but his messmates, always ready
for a lark, insisted that so doubtful a question must
be decided by trial of battle. A ring being formed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Farragut, after a short contest, succeeded in thrashing
his opponent and regaining the pig, and with it a
certain amount of complacency in that one Briton at
least had felt the pangs of defeat. His grief mastered
him again soon afterward, when asked by Captain
Hillyar to breakfast with himself and Captain
Porter. Hillyar, seeing his discomfiture, spoke to
him with great kindness, saying: "Never mind, my
little fellow, it will be your turn next perhaps"; to
which, says Farragut, "I replied I hoped so, and left
the cabin to hide my emotion."</p>

<p>After the action Porter and Hillyar entered into
an arrangement by which the Essex Junior was disarmed
and allowed to proceed to the United States
as a cartel, under the charge of Lieutenant Downes,
who had commanded her while a United States cruiser.
All the survivors of the Essex except two, whose
wounds did not permit, embarked in her and sailed
from Valparaiso on the 27th of April for the United
States, arriving on the 7th of July in New York.
On the 5th, off the coast of Long Island, she was
stopped by a British ship-of-war, whose captain questioned
the right of Hillyar to give her the passports
she carried, and indicated an intention of detaining
her. Porter construed this violation of the stipulation
between himself and his captor as releasing him
from his obligations, and escaped to shore with a
boat's crew. After a detention of nearly twenty-four
hours the vessel was allowed to proceed; but was
again overhauled by another British frigate as she
approached Sandy Hook. There could be no serious
question of detaining a ship that had been given
a safeguard, under such circumstances and with such
deliberation, by so experienced an officer as Hillyar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
But it is instructive to Americans, who are accustomed
to see in the war of 1812 only a brilliant series
of naval victories, to note that within a few hours' sail
of their principal port British cruisers were lying in
perfect security, stopping whom they would.</p>

<p>The Essex, upon which Farragut made his maiden
cruise, and whose interesting career ended in so
sad a catastrophe, remained, of course, in the hands
of the victors. The little frigate was patched up
and taken to England, where she was bought into
the British Navy, and was borne on its register until
1837, when she was sold. After that all trace of her
history is lost.</p>

<p>The Essex Junior, being a prize to the Essex and
allowed to pass under Hillyar's safeguard, was sold
in New York for the benefit of the captors.</p>

<h3>MIDSHIPMAN TO LIEUTENANT.<br /><br />

1814-1825.</h3>


<p>In common with the other survivors of the Essex,
Farragut landed in the United States as a paroled
prisoner of war. Captain Porter took him at once
to Chester and put him again to school, this time
to an old gentleman named Neif, who had served in
the guards of Napoleon. The method of instruction
practiced by him seems to have been unsystematic
and discursive; but Farragut, who was ever attentive
to make the most of such opportunities as
offered for self-improvement, derived profit here also,
and said afterward that the time thus passed had
been of service to him throughout his life. Until
very lately there were residents of that neighborhood
who could recall the young midshipman as he
was at Neif's school; a lad short of stature and not
very handsome in face, but who bore himself very
erect because, as he often declared, he could not
afford to lose a fraction of one of his scanty inches.
There was, and still is, near the spot where he went
to school a tavern called the Seven Stars, which has
been a public house since the time of the Revolution,
and which had sheltered Howe and Cornwallis as the
British army advanced from the head of the Chesa<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>peake
toward Philadelphia, in 1777. Upon its porch
Farragut spent much of his leisure time, and within
its walls joined in the social gayeties of the neighboring
families, who afterward recalled with pride and
interest this association with the young sailor before
whom lay such a brilliant but unforeseen future.</p>

<p>In November, 1814, Farragut was exchanged, and
at once ordered to New York to join the brig Spark,
which was intended to form one of a squadron of
small vessels to cruise against British commerce under
the command of Captain Porter. He was here
for the first time separated from his guardian and
thrown wholly upon his own force of character to
guide his steps; and this beginning was made with a
set of messmates with whom he was temporarily
quartered on board the John Adams, among whom
were several very wild young men. Farragut evidently
felt the force of the temptation, for he speaks
with warm thankfulness of the counter-influence of
the first lieutenant, to which he attributed much of
his deliverance from the dissipation by which he was
surrounded. "When I have looked back with a feeling
of horror to that period of my life," he wrote,
"I have always remembered with gratitude Mr.
Cocke's counsels and kind-hearted forbearance." It
was indeed characteristic of the man that, while by
no means insensible to the natural temptations of
youth, he was ever more attracted to and influenced
by the good than by the evil around him. During
the following year, on his cruise to the Mediterranean,
he was messmate with a midshipman
named William Taylor, a young man of singularly
fine character, which seems to have been the chief
cause of the influence he exerted upon Farragut.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
"He took me under his charge, counseled me kindly,
and inspired me with sentiments of true manliness,
which were the reverse of what I might have learned
from the examples I saw in the steerage of the John
Adams. Never having had any real love for dissipation,
I easily got rid of the bad influences which
had assailed me in that ship." He noted also that,
of the twelve or thirteen midshipmen there associated
with him, in less than two years all but one, his old
messmate Ogden, of the Essex, had disappeared from
the navy. The habit of strict attention to duty
which he had contracted under the rule of the Essex
also contributed, by keeping him occupied and attentive,
to deter him from yielding to practices incompatible
with its due discharge.</p>

<p>The conclusion of peace put an end to the proposed
cruise of the Spark, and Farragut was next ordered,
in March, 1815, to the Independence, a seventy-four-gun
ship, or ship-of-the-line, as such were commonly
called. She was the flag-ship of a numerous
squadron, composed mostly of small vessels, destined
to act against Algiers, with whom war had recently
been declared. Upon arriving in the Mediterranean
it was found that Commodore Decatur had already
brought the Dey to terms, so that Farragut saw here
no more fighting, and the squadron returned home
by winter. The following spring he was ordered to
the Washington, also a seventy-four, about to sail
for Naples, bearing on board Mr. William Pinkney,
our minister to that court. This cruise gave our
young midshipman an experience of a kind he had
not before had, and which in more ways than one
was useful to him. The Washington was one of
those exceptional vessels which illustrated in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
highest degree the kind and pitch of perfection to
which, by unremitting severity and exaction, the
appearance and drills of a ship-of-war could be
brought. Her commander, Captain Creighton, had
the reputation of being the greatest martinet in the
navy; and being seconded by a singularly efficient
and active set of officers, the ship was made to realize
the extreme ideal of a naval officer of that day
in smartness, order, and spotless cleanliness.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> "But,"
says Farragut, "all this was accomplished at the
sacrifice of the comfort of every one on board. My
experience in the matter, instead of making me a
proselyte to the doctrine of the old officers on this
subject, determined me never to have 'a crack ship'
if it was only to be attained by such means." His
feeling on the matter was doubtless somewhat quickened
by the personal discomfort which he, in common
with all subordinates, underwent under such a system,
although he was rather a favorite with the captain,
whose aid he was; but it shows independence
of character to have thought so clearly for himself
at such an age, and to have ventured to differ from
standards which were then, and for a long time afterward,
implicitly accepted throughout the service.
The tradition of those days, being mainly oral, has
nearly disappeared; but fragments of it remain here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and there in the minds of those who, as youngsters
thirty or forty years ago, were brought in contact
with men, then already elderly, who had had personal
experience of ships like the Washington. These
stories, in their grotesque severities, have almost the
air of an extravaganza. It must, however, be in
justice remembered that they were the extravagances
of a few among the men who had brought
the United States Navy to the high efficiency in
which it then was; and to whom, and not to either
the people or the Government of that day, was due
the glorious record of 1812. A few of them added
to their military ardor and efficiency an undue
amount of that spirit of the good housekeeper which
makes a home unbearable. Farragut was aided to
his wise conclusion by his previous experience in the
Essex, where a high state of efficiency was gained
without wanton sacrifice of comfort; for Porter,
though a man of hasty temper, was ever considerate
of his crew. But for the naval officers of that day
Farragut throughout his life retained a profound admiration.
Talking about them at his dinner-table
in New Orleans fifty years later, but a few days before
his famous passage of the Mobile forts, he said:
"We have no better seamen in the service to-day
than those gallant fellows Bainbridge, Decatur,
Hull, Perry, Porter, and Charles Stewart; and," he
added, "I must not forget to mention McDonough,
and poor unlucky Lawrence, as splendid-looking a
sailor as I ever saw. If I only had their chance and
could lay the Hartford alongside of an English ship,
I should like it better than fighting our own people."
Some years later he again expressed the same feelings
to the same friend, to whom the author is indebted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
for the communication of them. His own glorious
career was then finished, and his life's work lay open
to the mature reflection of his declining years, when
he thus acknowledged his obligations to the heroes
of his boyhood. "Isaac Hull," he said, "was as good
a seaman as ever sailed a ship. If I have done the
country any service afloat, it is in no small degree
owing to the ambition and enthusiasm he created in
me, when I was a youngster, by his fair fight with
and capture of an English frigate. I always envied
Hull that piece of good work." It is to be suspected
that the Admiral always felt that something was
lacking to the fullness of his cup, in that he had
only been allowed to fight forts, and not ships like
his own; and it is no small evidence of the generosity
of his character that his enthusiasm was so
aroused by the deeds of others. He spoke of the
fight between the Kearsarge and the Alabama in as
glowing terms as were aroused by his recollection
of the Constitution and the Guerrière. "I had
sooner have fought that fight," he wrote, "than any
ever fought upon the ocean."</p>

<p>The Washington stopped a few days at Gibraltar,
where the rest of the squadron were then at anchor;
and then sailed with all of them in company to Naples.
During the remainder of the year 1816 the
ship cruised along the Barbary coast until the winter
had fairly set in, when she with the other vessels
repaired to Port Mahon. Although now so close to
the spot where his race originated, Farragut's journal
betrays no interest in the fact. He was still too
young for the sentimental considerations to weigh
much in his mind; and it was not till many years
later, in the height of his glory as a naval com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>mander,
that he visited his father's birthplace,
Ciudadela, the capital city of Minorca. In the following
spring the squadron resumed its cruising
and made quite a round of the Mediterranean west
of Italy; the journal mentioning visits to Gibraltar,
Malaga, Leghorn, Naples, Sicily, and the cities on
the Barbary coast. Farragut made full and intelligent
use of the opportunities thus afforded him for
seeing the world; and his assiduous habit of observation
did much to store his mind with information,
which the circumstances of his early life had prevented
his gaining in the ordinary ways of school
and reading. He was fortunate also at this time in
having the society of an intelligent and cultivated
man, the chaplain of the Washington, Mr. Charles
Folsom. The chaplain in those days was commonly
the only schoolmaster the midshipmen had; and
their opportunities of learning from him depended
very much upon the pressure exercised by the captain
to compel the attention of a set of boys. Mr.
Folsom, however, was drawn to Farragut by the
eager willingness of the latter to acquire, and by
his sense of his deficiencies. The manly character
which had resisted the temptations to low dissipation,
and sought naturally the companionship of the better
rather than the worse among his associates, also
attracted him. The friendship thus formed became,
through a series of incidents, the cause of an unusual
opportunity for improvement being offered to
Farragut. In the autumn of 1817 Mr. Folsom received
the appointment of consul to Tunis, which
had just been vacated. The summer cruising of
the squadron was drawing to an end, and the winter
quarters at Port Mahon about to be resumed. There<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>fore,
while the Washington was lying in Gibraltar,
Mr. Folsom wrote to the commander-in-chief, Commodore
Chauncey, asking permission to take the
young midshipman to spend the winter with him in
Tunis, to pursue his education under his care. In
the letter he spoke very earnestly of his pupil's zeal
for improvement, of his close attention, and ready
response to any effort on the part of his instructor.
The letter is interesting also in its recognition of
Farragut's still existing relations to Captain Porter,
"to whose wishes this request can not be repugnant."
The letter was dated October 14, 1817; and, the required
permission being given, the two friends in
the following month sailed from Gibraltar for Marseille
as passengers in the sloop-of-war Erie. At
Marseille a slight incident occurred which, while not
quite creditable to our hero, may have interest as
showing natural character. Spending the evening
at the house of a Mr. Fitch, he was, much against his
will, obliged to play whist, for which he had no fondness.
"Not getting along very well with my hand,
the party showed great impatience, and I thought
were rather insulting in their remarks. One individual
went so far as to dash his cards on the table in
derision of my play, when I returned the compliment
by throwing them at his head. I apologized
to Mr. Fitch and retired, much mortified, but my
temper had been sorely tried." The display of temper
was scarcely more than the provocation justified;
and it is noteworthy that during a period when dueling
was so common Farragut, though quick to resent,
appears never to have been involved in a serious
personal difficulty.</p>

<p>Early in 1818 the Erie, carrying Mr. Folsom and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
his pupil, arrived in Tunis, where the latter remained
for nine months, pursuing his studies on the
site of the ancient maritime empire of Carthage. He
mentions particularly the subjects of mathematics,
English literature, French, and Italian. For languages
he had great natural aptitude, and in later
life was able to converse in several. The monotony
of study was varied by the society of the few but
agreeable foreign families residing in Tunis, and by
occasional excursions in the neighborhood; when
the interest of the present was happily blended,
under the guidance of such a man as Mr. Folsom,
with thoughts upon the past grandeur and history of
the Carthaginian empire and the Roman province
which had successively flourished on that soil. In
one of these excursions Farragut received a partial
stroke of the sun, from the effects of which he suffered
for many years.</p>

<p>The period of his stay in Tunis exceeded the
original intention, but doubtless with the approval
of the commodore. It was brought to a close in the
fall of 1818 by an outbreak of the plague, which
increased to such an alarming extent that Mr. Folsom
felt compelled to send his charge away just
when the approach of another winter of comparative
idleness for the squadron would have justified a longer
stay. But deaths in Tunis had risen to a hundred a
day, and all the families were living in a state of
complete isolation, the houses being barricaded
against outsiders; therefore on the 9th of October
Farragut departed in a Genoese brig for Leghorn.
Thence, after a quarantine of forty days, he went to
Pisa; and from there to Messina, where the squadron
had assembled for the winter of 1818-'19.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>The friendship between Farragut and Mr. Folsom
did not end with this separation. The latter survived
to the end of the civil war, and was thus privileged
to follow the successful and great career of
the admiral to whom, while yet an unformed boy, he
had thoughtfully extended a helping hand. As late
as 1865 letters passed between the two, showing that
both cherished warm recollections of that early
association; Mr. Folsom dating his, as though careful
to make the coincidence, on the anniversary of
the day when he parted with his pupil in the harbor
of Tunis and returned alone to the plague-stricken
city.</p>

<p>The officers of the United States squadron passed
a gay winter in Messina in 1819. Farragut was not
yet eighteen years of age, but his bodily development
had kept pace with his mental, and he writes
that he always held his own at this time in all athletic
exercises. The succeeding spring and summer
were again spent in routine cruising on board the
Franklin, seventy-four, which had taken the place of
the Washington. In the fall of 1819 the squadron
was in Gibraltar; and there, "after much opposition,"
Farragut was appointed an acting lieutenant on
board the brig Shark. This promotion, coming at
so early an age, he afterward looked upon as one of
the most important events of his life. "It caused
me to feel that I was now associated with men, on
an equality, and must act with more circumspection.
When I became first lieutenant, my duties were still
more important, for in truth I was really commander
of the vessel, and yet I was not responsible (as such)&mdash;an
anomalous position which has spoiled some of
our best officers. I consider it a great advantage to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
obtain command young, having observed, as a general
rule, that persons who come into authority late in life
shrink from responsibility, and often break down under
its weight." This last sentence, coming from a
man of such extensive observation, and who bore in
his day the responsibility of such weighty decisions,
deserves most serious consideration now, when command
rank is reached so very late in the United
States Navy.</p>

<p>After a short year in the Shark Farragut was
ordered to return to the United States, to pass the
examination required of all midshipmen before they
could be confirmed to the rank of lieutenant. No
opportunity offering for passage in a ship-of-war, he
embarked in a merchant vessel called the America.
On the passage he found himself, with the ship, confronted
by an apparent danger, which occasioned a
display of the fearlessness and energy always latent
in his character. Those were days when piracy was
rife upon the seas in the neighborhood of the West
Indies and of the Spanish Main. The system was an
outgrowth of the privateering carried on by French
and Spanish marauders, for they were little better,
against both British and neutral commerce during
the wars of the French Revolution and Empire; and
it had received a fresh impulse from the quarrel then
existing between Spain and her American colonies,
which since 1810 had been in revolt against the
mother country. Privateering, having booty as its
sole motive, rapidly tends to indiscriminate robbery,
if not held strictly responsible by the country using
it; and the remote, extensive, and secluded shores
of Cuba, Haïti, and the South American coast defied
the careless supervision of the weak Spanish Govern<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>ment.
When within a few days' sail of the United
States, the America fell in with an armed brig showing
the colors of the new Colombian republic; but a flag
was little guarantee for the character of a vessel if
other signs told against her. Farragut describes both
captain and crew of the America as being so overwhelmed
with fear that, though expecting no mercy,
they entertained no idea of resistance. Under the
circumstances he took command; and having, fortunately,
as passengers two seamen from the squadron
going home sick, these formed a nucleus around
which rallied the courage of the others, paralyzed
only through disuse. It was, however, the firmness
of the lad of eighteen, supported by his position as
an officer and acting upon the two men prepared to
recognize him as such, that redeemed the others from
imbecility to manhood. The incident had no results,
the stranger proving to be a regularly commissioned
cruiser, and treating them with civility. Farragut's
thoughtful, not to say philosophical, turn of mind
was shown in his recorded reflections upon the difference
between the conduct of the man-of-war's men
and the merchant seamen, which he justly attributed
not to inherent difference of natural courage, but to
the habit of arms and of contemplating danger under
a particular form.</p>

<p>On the 20th of November, 1820, Farragut again
landed in the United States, having been absent four
years and a half. He felt himself a stranger, having
left as a mere boy, and knowing no one but Commodore
Porter and his family. His examination soon
followed, and was passed; but apparently not quite
to his own satisfaction. A period of comparative
quiet followed, spent principally in Norfolk, Virginia,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
during which he formed the attachment which resulted
in his first marriage. In May, 1822, he was
again ordered to sea in the sloop-of-war John Adams,
in which he made a short cruise in the Gulf of Mexico
and to Vera Cruz, where the Spanish power in
Mexico was then making its last stand in the well-known
fortress, San Juan de Ulloa. The ship returned
to the United States early in December, 1822,
when Farragut found the Mosquito fleet, as it was
called, fitting out against the pirates of the Caribbean
Sea. Learning that it was to be commanded by his
old captain, Commodore David Porter, he asked for
and obtained orders to the Greyhound, one of the
small vessels composing it, commanded by Lieutenant
John Porter, a brother of the commodore.</p>

<p>Since the peace with Great Britain, Captain Porter
had been a member of the Board of Navy Commissioners;
a body of three officers appointed by an
act of Congress passed early in 1815, whose duties
were to administer the affairs of the navy under the
supervision of the Secretary. Meanwhile the sufferings,
not only of American property but of the persons
of American citizens, from the prevalence of
piracy in the Caribbean Sea, had become unendurable.
Ordinary naval vessels were, from their size,
unable to enforce a repression for which it was
necessary to follow the freebooters and their petty
craft into their lairs among the lagoons and creeks
of the West India islands. The general outcry
rousing the Government to the necessity of further
exertion, Captain Porter offered his services to extirpate
the nuisance; with the understanding that he
was to have and fit out the kind of force he thought
necessary for the service. He resigned his position<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
on the board on the 31st of December, 1822; but
before that date he had bought and begun to equip
eight Chesapeake schooners, of fifty to sixty tons
burden, of which the Greyhound, Farragut's new
vessel, was one. He also built five rowing barges,
unusually large, pulling twenty oars. With these,
supported by the ordinary man-of-war schooners, of
which several were already in the service, and by
the sloops-of-war, he expected to drive the pirates
not merely off the sea, but out of their hiding-places.</p>

<p>The commodore put to sea with all his squadron
on the 14th of February, 1823. A northeast gale was
at once encountered, but the tiny vessels ran through
it without any harm. For the next six months Farragut
was actively employed in the operations of the
little fleet, the Greyhound being one of the five
which were sent through the Mona Passage, between
Porto Rico and Haïti, and thence ransacked the
southern shores of the latter island and of Cuba as
far as Cape San Antonio, where Cuba ends. There
were many encounters between the pirates and the
squadron, sometimes afloat, sometimes ashore, in
several of which our officer served, forcing his way
with his party through marsh and chaparral and
cactus&mdash;a service often perilous, always painful and
exhausting. His health fortunately held out through
it; nor did he take the yellow fever, which, as the
summer wore on, made sad havoc among both officers
and men. Toward the end of his time he obtained
the command of one of the Mosquito schooners,
which, however, he held but for a short period;
for, not having yet received his lieutenant's commission,
he was relieved by the arrival of an officer of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
that rank. An interesting incident of this cruise was
a meeting with his brother William, then already a
lieutenant, whom he had not seen for thirteen years.
Soon after that he obtained permission to visit New
Orleans; and it is a curious coincidence that the
vessel in which he took passage thither was carrying
the first load of bricks to build Fort Jackson, one of
the defenses of New Orleans, by the passage of
which nearly forty years later he began his career as
commander-in-chief. His father had then been many
years dead; but he met his sister, with whom he had
to make acquaintance after so long a separation.</p>

<p>The service of the Mosquito fleet was one of
great exposure and privation. "I never owned a
bed during my two years and a half in the West
Indies," wrote Farragut, "but lay down to rest
wherever I found the most comfortable berth." It
was, however, effectual, both directly and indirectly,
to the suppression of piracy; seconded as it was by
the navy of Great Britain, interested like our own
country in the security of commerce. Driven off the
water, with their lurking-places invaded, their plunder
seized, their vessels burned, their occupation
afloat gone, the marauders organized themselves
into bandits, and turned their predatory practices
against the towns and villages. This roused the
Spanish governors from the indolent complacency
with which they had watched robberies upon foreigners
that brought profit rather than loss to their
districts. When the evil was thus brought home,
the troops were put in motion; and the pirates,
beset on both sides, gradually but rapidly disappeared.</p>

<p>This Mosquito war had, however, one very sad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
result in depriving the navy of the eminent services
of Commodore Porter. In 1824 a gratuitous insult,
accompanied by outrage, offered to one of his officers,
led him to land a party at the town of Foxardo,
in Porto Rico, and force an apology from the guilty
officials. Although no complaint seems to have
been made by Spain, the United States Government
took exception to his action and brought him to
trial by court-martial. Porter confidently expected
an acquittal, having proof that the outrage was
wanton, and that the officials had engaged in it to
protect some piratical plunder which had been taken
into the place. He argued also that the wording of
his orders from the department authorized his action.
The court, however, found him guilty of an
offense which was charged as "disobedience of orders,
and conduct unbecoming an officer," and sentenced
him to six months' suspension. The sentence
was accompanied by the expression that the court
"ascribes the conduct of the accused which is deemed
censurable to an anxious disposition, on his part, to
maintain the honor and advance the interest of the
nation and of the service." Indignant at the result,
Porter resigned from the navy and took service with
the Mexican Republic. After spending there four
years of harassing disappointments, the election of
General Jackson to the presidency gave him a friend
in power. He returned to the United States in October,
1829, under the encouragement of letters from
persons closely connected with the new administration.
The President offered to nominate him to his
old position in the navy, but Porter declined "to
associate with the men who sentenced me for upholding
the honor of the flag." This, striking a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
kindred chord in Jackson's breast, elicited a warm
note of approval, and he appointed the commodore
Consul-General to Algiers. The conquest of
that country by France put an end to the office
before he could assume the duties. The President
then nominated him to be Chargé d'Affaires
to Turkey. He went there in August, 1831, became
Minister Resident in 1839, and died in this
post in 1843.</p>

<p>After his return from the Mosquito fleet, Farragut
married, on the 24th of September, 1823, Miss
Susan C. Marchant, the daughter of a gentleman of
Norfolk, Virginia. He was at this time far from
well; fever, which spared him while on that sickly
service, having seized him upon arrival in a healthier
climate. It was probably due in part to this that
two years passed after his marriage before he again
joined a ship. During this period he spent some
weeks with his bride in the house of Commodore
Porter, who had returned temporarily from his squadron
to regain his strength after a severe attack of
yellow fever. This was probably his last close personal
association with his early benefactor, whom
the issue of the trial afterward separated from his
country; but the correspondence between the two
continued through life, Farragut maintaining to the
last a grateful recollection of kindness shown to him
by one whom he termed his "most venerated friend
and commander." As late as 1835, writing from Constantinople
in reply to a letter received from his former
ward, Porter, then an ailing and broken man,
notices this trait in him: "I have found in yours that
treasure of a grateful heart which should be so much
prized. I have never looked for any other return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
than what my feelings gave me, and to find such sentiments
of gratitude from you, after all others had
forgotten that they had received any benefits from
me, is truly refreshing to the feelings." The relations
thus testified to are an honor to the memory
of both.</p>

<h3>LIEUTENANT.<br /><br />

1825-1841.</h3>


<p>After the termination of his cruise in the Mosquito
fleet, and up to the beginning of the Civil War,
the story of Farragut's life is for the most part but
the record of the routine service of a naval officer
in times of peace&mdash;periods of distant foreign cruising
succeeding to, and being again succeeded by, periods
of employment on shore in some of the many duties
connected with the administration of the navy. But
while in their superficial aspect there is little to distinguish
these monotonous years, with their occasional
breaks of exceptional incident, from the ordinary
experiences of all naval officers, the journal
of Farragut shows an activity of mind, a constant
habit of observation, especially in professional matters,
and a painstaking diligence in embracing every
passing opportunity for improvement, which reveal
to some extent the causes of his subsequent great
successes. It is not indeed always possible to trace
the precise connection between this or that observation,
this or that course of study, and the later results;
it is rather in the constant habit of doing the
best at every moment, and in the gradual formation
of mental character and correct professional knowl<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>edge,
that are to be found the fruits of the strenuous
exertion made throughout his life by Admiral Farragut.
It is a noteworthy, though by no means unprecedented,
circumstance that these characteristics
obtained little or no recognition during his early and
middle career. Unlike the great British admiral,
Nelson, no war occurred to bring his high qualities
into notice; and, when lacking but a year of Nelson's
age when he fell at Trafalgar, Farragut was
vainly petitioning the Navy Department for the
command of a sloop-of-war in the war with Mexico,
although he alleged his intimate knowledge of the
scene of operations, the close personal examination
he had made of it, and the privilege he had had of
witnessing an attack by a French squadron but a
few years before.</p>

<p>The early age at which he had left his home, the
long absences of his youth, and the death of his father,
had all contributed to sever his associations
with New Orleans; so that his marriage in Norfolk,
as was the case with so many officers of his day, fixed
that city as his place of residence when not at sea.
It is worthy of remembrance, in connection with his
firm determination at a later day to stand by the
Union rather than by a section of the country, that
the only home Farragut had known out of a ship-of-war
was the Southern city where he had twice married,
and where the general sentiment was contrary
to the course he took. The interest of the fact lies not
in its bearing upon the rights or wrongs of the great
quarrel that all are now fain to forget, but in showing
the rare strength of character which, sustained only
by its own clear convictions, resisted the social and
friendly influences that overcame so many others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>In August, 1825, Farragut was promoted to be
lieutenant, and at the same time ordered to the frigate
Brandywine, chosen to carry back to France Lafayette,
who was just drawing to a close his memorable
visit to the United States. The ship sailed
from the capes of the Chesapeake in September,
reaching Havre after a passage of twenty-five days.
From there she went to England, and thence to the
Mediterranean, returning to New York in May, 1826.
After his arrival Farragut was detached and went to
New Haven with his wife, who had become a great
sufferer from neuralgia and continued to be an invalid
during the remainder of their married life.
While living in New Haven he availed himself of
the opportunity to attend lectures at Yale College.
After his wife's treatment was finished they returned
to Norfolk, where he remained until October, 1828,
attached to the receiving ship and living on board
with Mrs. Farragut. Here the interest which he
had showed in the improvement of his own mind was
transferred to the ship's boys, most of whom did
not even know their letters. Farragut organized a
school for these waifs, who at that time were little
accustomed to receive such care, and was gratified to
find very tangible results in the improvement shown
by them. He next received orders to the sloop-of-war
Vandalia, which sailed from Philadelphia in the last
days of 1828 for the Brazil station. On this cruise,
which for him lasted but a year, he for the first time
visited the Rio de la Plata and Buenos Ayres, and
came in contact with the afterward celebrated dictator
of that country, Rosas. The different provinces,
whose union is now known by the political name of
the Argentine Republic, had, under the later days of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Spanish rule, constituted with Bolivia, Paraguay and
Uruguay the Viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres. On the
25th of May, 1810, a declaration of independence
was issued in the city of Buenos Ayres. A long period
of disturbance, internal and external, followed.
At the time of this first visit of Farragut a contest
had for some time been going on between two parties,
representing two opposite political ideas, and
striving in arms for the control of the State. The
ideal of one was a strong centralized government
supported by a powerful standing army. This naturally
found its most numerous constituents among
the wealthy and educated inhabitants of the principal
city, Buenos Ayres. The province of the same
name, however, and the other provinces generally,
favored a looser form of confederation. The former
party, known as the Unitarios, held a brief lease of
power; but their opponents found an able leader in
Juan Manuel de Rosas, who personified the best and
worst features of the <i>gaucho</i> of the pampas and obtained
unbounded popularity and following among
those wild herdsmen. In 1828 Rosas and his allies
forced the Unitarian president to resign, and installed
one of themselves, named Dorrego, as governor of
Buenos Ayres. This success was but one step in the
series of bloody struggles which ended in the establishment
of the dictator; but it marked the point at
which Farragut first saw Buenos Ayres and Rosas
himself, with whom he was at a later date thrown in
intimate contact and who at that moment was in the
full flush of his early popularity.</p>

<p>In December, 1829, Farragut's eyes were in such
bad condition that it was found necessary to send
him home. He arrived in February, 1830, and re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>mained
in Norfolk for a period of nearly three years,
broken only by occasional absences. During a part
of this time he was again attached to the receiving
ship in the port; and, as before, manifested an interest,
unusual in those days, in those under his command.
One of these, then a midshipman, writes to
the author that he still recalls, after the lapse of
nearly sixty years, the kindness, consideration and
hospitality shown him by the future admiral, who
was then known through the service as the "Little
Luff" Farragut&mdash;luff being a naval abbreviation, now
obsolete, for lieutenant. But with all his kindness
there was no relaxation in the enforcement of necessary
duty. In December, 1832, he was again ordered
to sea in the sloop-of-war Natchez, as her first lieutenant;
or, as the expression now is, as executive
officer. It was the time of the nullification troubles
in South Carolina, and the ship was first sent to anchor
near Charleston, where she would be prepared
to support the authority of the United States Government.
Fortunately, no occasion arose for her to
act; and a stay which began with taking precautions
against possible fire-ships from the city, ended in a
series of balls and general exchanges of courtesy between
the officers and the citizens. In April, 1833,
the Natchez returned to Hampton Roads; and the
following month sailed, carrying Farragut back again
to the Brazils. On the 30th of July he was again at
anchor, in his new ship, off Buenos Ayres. Since his
former visit the country had passed through much
trouble. A confederation had been formed between
the principal provinces, in January, 1831, based upon
the loosest ties of union; but the army had become
dissatisfied with the progress of changes which arose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
largely from jealousy of the military power, and had
risen in revolt under the leadership of a general
named Lavalle, who for a time had sided with Rosas.
He met at first with success, defeated Dorrego and
Rosas, and put the former to death; but Rosas rallied
again, defeated Lavalle, and became in his place
head of the army and governor of Buenos Ayres.
To this position he was re-elected in 1832, and by
virtue of it he was, at the time of Farragut's second
visit, in chief control of the external policy and internal
affairs of the confederation; the principal
and seaboard province inevitably taking the lead
and representing the country under even the loosest
form of combination. Disturbed though the internal
state of affairs was, Rosas's strong hand appears to
have so far preserved the safety of foreigners as to
give no cause for the interference of their ships-of-war.
Farragut's stay on the station was, however,
again cut short. The schooner Boxer arrived in
Rio Janeiro on her way home from the East Indies;
and it becoming necessary to give her a new commanding
officer, he received orders to take her to
the United States. He sailed in her on the 8th of
June, 1834, and on the 25th of July reached Norfolk,
where the vessel was put out of commission and he
again returned to his family. A period of nearly
four years of shore duty followed. During the latter
two of these Farragut was a constant applicant for
sea service, which he could not obtain. His wife
was at this time becoming ever weaker and weaker.
"I was necessarily confined very much to the house,"
he writes, "for my wife was so helpless I was obliged
to lift her and carry her about like a child." His
tender and untiring devotion to the suffering invalid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
was no less conspicuous than his careful attention
to the other duties of life, and was the constant remark
of those who were witnesses of this sorrowful
period.</p>

<p>In April, 1838, Farragut was again ordered to sea
in the home squadron, and in the following August,
though still only a lieutenant, took command, in Pensacola,
of the sloop-of-war Erie; a position that could
only be temporary, because belonging naturally to
an officer of higher rank. It fell to him, however,
at a period of peculiar interest&mdash;when France became
involved with Mexico in one of those brief
hostilities by which alone were broken the long
years of peace between Waterloo and the Crimean
War. The quarrel between the two was simply as to
the reparation due to French subjects for injuries
received during the long years of confusion through
which Mexico then had been and still was passing.
As a political question it possesses no present interest
whatever; but to a naval officer of Farragut's
strong professional feeling and close habits of observation
it offered a peculiar opportunity for noting
the silent progress made during the long peace by the
material of war among the navies of Europe, where
the necessity of constant preparation insures an advance
in which the United States then, as now, tended
to lag behind. It supplied also a test, under certain
conditions, of the much-vexed question of the power
of ships against forts; for the French squadron,
though few in numbers, deliberately undertook to
batter by horizontal fire, as well as to bombard, in
the more correct sense of the word, with the vertical
fire of mortars, the long renowned castle of San
Juan de Ulloa, the chief defense of Vera Cruz. It<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
was still the day of sailing-ships, both of war and of
commerce. But a few years had elapsed since a man
of considerable scientific attainment had pronounced
the crossing of the Atlantic to be impossible to vessels
depending upon steam power alone; and only in
the same year as the French attack on Vera Cruz
(1838) had been seen the falsification of the prediction
by the passage of the Sirius and Great Western from
England to New York.</p>

<p>As a first means of compulsion, the French Government
had in 1837 established a blockade of the
Atlantic ports of Mexico. In two months the Mexican
treasury lost two million dollars in duties, which
would have been collected if the ships turned away
had been permitted to enter; but the Government
and people seemed little moved by a result that
merely added one more to the many ills with which
they were already afflicted. The question was then
raised by the French authorities, diplomatic and
military, whether the possession of the fortress of
San Juan de Ulloa, which commanded the city of
Vera Cruz, the most important of the coast ports,
would not also confer control of a great part of the
seaboard, and thus enforce a security not otherwise
obtainable for the persons and property of French
subjects. Blockade, though a less extreme measure,
was difficult, protracted, and productive of serious
loss. The violent northerly gales of winter exposed
the ships to peril, and the yellow fever of the summer
months was deadly to the crews. Moreover, the
deprivation of commerce, though a bitter evil to a
settled community whose members were accustomed
to the wealth, luxury, and quiet life attendant upon
uninterrupted mercantile pursuits, had been proved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
ineffective when applied to a people to whom quiet
and luxuries were the unrealized words of a dream.
The French Government speedily determined to abandon
the half-measure for one of more certain results;
and in October, 1838, began to arrive the ships of an
expedition destined to proceed to open hostilities,
under the command of Admiral Baudin, a veteran of
the Napoleonic wars. Appointed in the navy in 1799,
immediately after the return from Egypt and the establishment
of the Consulate, by the direct intervention
of Bonaparte, who was a friend of his father's,
Baudin had served with distinction until the fall
of the empire, losing his right arm in battle; and
after Waterloo it was he who made the proposition,
familiar to all readers of Napoleon's life, to cover
the escape of the Emperor from Rochefort by sacrificing
the ships under his command in an heroic resistance
to the English cruisers while the vessel
bearing the fallen monarch escaped. "Sixteen years
ago," said he, "my father died of joy upon learning
the return from Egypt of General Bonaparte; and I
myself to-day would die of grief to see the Emperor
leave France if I thought that by remaining he could
again do aught for her. But he must leave her only
to live honored in a free country, not to die a prisoner
to our rivals." Such was that career, belonging to
an early and singular generation, which here for a
moment crossed and linked with that of the great
naval hero of our own days. Farragut has recorded
his impression of him. "Admiral Baudin," he writes,
"would be undoubtedly a <i>rara avis</i> in any navy. He
is about fifty years of age (he was fifty-four), has
lost his right arm, looks like a North of Europe man,
has a fine address, and speaks English well. He has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
every mark of a polished seaman and officer, with
the expression of great decision, with firmness and
activity to execute his well-digested plans. These
were my remarks the first time I saw him, and his
subsequent conduct soon proved I was right." His
French biographer makes a remark, commonplace
enough, which yet notes the essential difference in
the lot of the two gallant men who thus casually met.
"For the few who allow occasions to escape them,
how many could justly complain that a chance has
never been offered them? Admiral Baudin never had
the opportunity to which his capacities suited him;
all his aptitudes designated him for war on a great
scale; a man such as he, succeeding Latouche-Tréville,
would have saved us the sorrows of Trafalgar."
Farragut was fortunate, for in him the opportunity
and the man met in happy combination.</p>

<p>When he reached his station, Admiral Baudin
suffered no time to be lost. The wintry gales were
approaching, while, on the other hand, his first experience
showed the miseries of disease on that sickly
coast. Of the two frigates there before he came,
which had been blockading during the summer, one
had buried forty-five seamen and five officers out of
a ship's company of four hundred men; the other, at
the time of his arrival, had three hundred and forty-three
sick among a crew of five hundred. With such
conditions, trifling is out of place. An ultimatum
was at once sent to the Mexican Government, a brief
time only being allowed for a reply, because the
claims of the French cabinet were already clearly
understood. On the 25th of November the last of his
squadron, two bomb-vessels, arrived. On the 21st he
had given notice that he would wait till noon of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
27th for the final decision. On the 28th the attack
was made.</p>

<p>The castle of San Juan de Ulloa lies half a mile
east and to seaward of the city of Vera Cruz, which
it commands, and from which it is separated by water
averaging from fifteen to twenty feet deep. It
is built on the inner extremity of a reef that extends
from it a little over a mile to the eastward, in the
general prolongation of the line connecting the castle
and the town. This shoal being covered by a foot
or two of water, the builders of the fort counted
upon it for protection in that direction against ships,
and against attack, either by regular approaches or
by escalade. The work itself was in general outline a
parallelogram, with bastions at the four angles. The
longer sides fronted the east and west; and of these
the former, facing the shoal and the open gulf, contained
the gate of the fortress and was covered by a
demi-lune and line of water batteries. There were
mounted in the castle and dependent works, at the
time of the French attacks, one hundred and eighty-six
cannon. The strength of the fortifications, the
number of the guns, and the character of the surroundings,
had all contributed to bestow upon San Juan de
Ulloa the reputation of being the strongest position
in Spanish America. It was, indeed, considered impregnable
to naval attack, for the best hope of ships
under such circumstances is to approach closely and
drive the defenders from their guns by the superior
number and weight of the pieces opposed to them;
but in San Juan this was forbidden by the extent and
formation of the reef. Like most coral banks, this
rises sheer from the bottom, making the approach
very dangerous to vessels dependent only upon sail-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>power;
and the ground about it, though not too deep
for anchorage, is rocky and foul.</p>

<p>Admiral Baudin, however, was thoroughly acquainted
with the weak points of the fortress, through
information obtained from Madrid; where plans of
the works, dating from the times of the Spanish
occupancy, were on file. He possessed also two
steamers, the first to cross the Atlantic under the
French flag, by aid of which, though small and of
weak power, he could count upon placing his sailing
frigates exactly where he wished them. Finally,
the wretched condition of the Mexican forces, demoralized
by years of irregular warfare and internal
commotion, and miserably provided with material of
war, gave additional chances of success.</p>

<p>On the morning of November 28th the two
steamers towed the bomb-vessels to the eastern extremity
of the reef, a little over a mile from the castle.
Next two of the frigates were taken by them
and anchored close to the reef, southeast from the
works and distant from them half a mile. The third
frigate, using her sails alone, succeeded in taking
position a little ahead of her consorts. These operations
were all completed before noon and were conducted
under the eyes of the Mexicans, who were
restrained from impeding them by the orders of their
Government not to fire the first gun. A delay followed,
owing to a flag of truce coming from the
shore; but the proposition brought by it proved unacceptable,
and the squadron opened fire at half-past
two. Between that and sundown the three frigates,
aided only by a small corvette which attacked under
way, poured upon the castle 7,771 round shot and
177 shell, the mortar-vessels at the same time throw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>ing
in 302 bombs. At eight the fire ceased, and negotiations
began. The following day, at noon, the
castle was delivered into the hands of the French,
who placed a garrison in it. "It was high time,"
said Admiral Baudin; "the wind was freshening, the
sea getting up, and the anchors were breaking like
glass upon the bottom, composed of sharp rocks."
But the loss among the defenders had been so great,
and the re-enforcements at hand were so few, that further
resistance was impracticable.</p>

<p>The terms of the convention made by the commander
of the Mexican forces had stipulated that
only a certain number of troops should constitute
the garrison of Vera Cruz until the affairs between
the two nations were settled; but upon the 4th of
December the French admiral learned, to his great
indignation, that the Mexican Government had disavowed
the action of the general, declared war
against France, and was throwing re-enforcements
into the city. He immediately took measures to disarm
the works which might threaten his fleet at their
anchorage, hoping at the same time, by surprising
the enemy, to gain possession of Santa Anna, the new
commander of the troops and then the most prominent
man in Mexico. While the French were making
their preparations in secret, Farragut went on shore
and called upon Santa Anna, who promised to care for
the persons and property of American citizens, adding:
"Tell President Van Buren that we are all one
family, and must be united against Europeans obtaining
a foothold on this continent."</p>

<p>The following morning, before daylight, the
French embarked fifteen hundred seamen, accompanied
by a few engineer soldiers, in the boats of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
squadron; and, being covered by a thick fog, landed
at six o'clock upon the beach before Vera Cruz.
Formed in three divisions and unseen by the enemy,
they blew open the gates of the city and at the same
time stormed the forts which at the north and south
terminate the seaward wall. The Mexicans, taken
wholly by surprise, retreated before the assailants.
The center division of the French, which had entered
by the gates, pursued rapidly toward the quarters of
Santa Anna. A short, vigorous resistance by a part
of his guard enabled the commander-in-chief to escape
in shirt and trousers; but General Arista was
taken. Meanwhile the two flank divisions, having
dismounted the guns in the forts and chopped the
carriages in pieces, moved along the walls toward
the gate. There they united with the center; and
the whole body, having accomplished its object in
disarming the sea face of the town, fell back upon
their boats lying along the mole. Most had already
re-embarked when the Mexicans, led by Santa Anna
in person, charged from the gate and down the mole
at double-quick. Admiral Baudin himself was still
on shore, waiting to see the last man off. Though
scarcely expecting this gallant return from a force
that had been so badly worsted and was much inferior
in numbers, the French were not unprepared.
A six-pound gun on the extremity of the mole, belonging
to the Mexicans, had been turned so as to
sweep the approach with grape; and five of the
boats of the squadron, mounting small carronades,
were also disposed to repel attack. The admiral
ordered the six-pounder fired, and entered his barge.
The discharge swept away the head of the Mexican
column, and Santa Anna himself fell with three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
wounds, from one of which he lost his left leg. Some
of the broken column fell back upon the town, from
the loop-holes of whose walls a sharp fire of musketry
began, while others continued down the mole and
opened vigorously upon the retreating French, directing
their aim especially upon the admiral's barge.
The admiral himself escaped, but narrowly; his cockswain
and a midshipman standing by him being killed,
and another midshipman wounded. "The Mexicans
continued to fight with great gallantry," wrote Farragut;
and it was perhaps well for the assailants that
the fog sweeping in again covered their further retreat.</p>

<p>Of all these incidents Farragut was a close and
interested observer. Upon joining the Erie as her
commander, he found that the ship was under orders
to proceed with the utmost dispatch to the Mexican
coast, to afford to American citizens and their property
the protection so likely to be needed in event of
active hostilities. On the 26th of August she was
anchored under the island of Sacrificios, off Vera
Cruz, which was then still undergoing the blockade
which preceded recourse to stronger measures. Farragut
remained there till the 19th of September,
when he returned to Pensacola; but early in November
he was again off the Mexican coast at Tampico,
where a revolution threatened, for Mexico at the
time was not only menaced with foreign attack, but
also a prey to the utmost internal disorder. On the
17th of this month the Erie ran down again to Vera
Cruz; and learning there that the 27th was fixed as
the day for a final conference and settlement of the
questions at issue, her commander of course decided
to remain throughout the affair, making preparations<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
to receive on board Americans and their movable
property in case the city was bombarded.</p>

<p>In his journal, and afterward in a letter to Commodore
Barron, then the senior officer in the United
States Navy, Farragut has preserved a very full and
detailed account of the attack, the principal features
of which have already been mentioned; and it is interesting
to note, as testifying to the care and accuracy
of his observations, that the account in his journal
corresponds very closely with that given in the Life
of Admiral Baudin, published in France within the
last few years. He was particularly impressed with,
and distinguishes as matters of principal importance,
the utility of the small French steamers in towing
the fighting ships into position, and the destructive
effects of the shell upon the soft masonry of the fort.
Admiral Baudin, in his reports, indulged in some of
the pardonable grumbling of a seaman of the old
school about the constant ailments of the little
steam-vessels; but he was too capable an officer to
ignore their value, "and never," wrote Farragut in
his report, "was the utility of these vessels so apparent.
Everything was done by them. The day
was calm, or nearly so, and the ships had no sails to
manage. As soon as the anchor was let go they
were ready for action. The bomb-vessels were next
placed (for which the range had been calculated),
and two sloops took position at right angles with
the range, to tell by signal the effect of the bombs.
So you see all was arranged with science and skill
and without the slightest interruption, for the Mexicans
had given an order to the commander of the
fort not on any account to fire the first gun." This
order was, in Farragut's opinion, the principal cause<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of the French sustaining so little loss. A well directed
fire from the fort would, he thought, have destroyed
the steamers and prevented the frigates from
gaining the carefully chosen position, where they
were least exposed to the guns of the works.</p>

<p>Immediately after the submission of the castle
Farragut went ashore to examine and note the effects
of the fire, and especially of the horizontal
shell fire; which was then so much a novelty in naval
warfare that he speaks of the missiles continuously
as shell-shot, apparently to distinguish them
from the vertically thrown bombs. "Now it was
seen for the first time that the material of which
Ulloa is built (soft coral) was the worst substance in
the world for protection against the modern shell.
The French threw almost entirely shell-shot, which
entered the wall twelve or eighteen inches and then
exploded, tearing out great masses of stone, and in
some instances rending the wall from base to top.
The damage done by these shell-shot was inconceivably
greater than that by the shell from the bomb-vessels,
owing to the former striking horizontally,
while the latter fell vertically upon the bomb-proofs,
doing but little damage.... I am satisfied of one
fact&mdash;viz., that they might have bombarded with the
bomb-vessels for a month without success, while the
frigates would in four hours more, with their shell-shot,
have reduced the fort to a heap of ruins."
This opinion as to the inefficacy of bomb-firing to
destroy a work anticipated the experience of the
Civil War, where the conclusion was that it might
wear out the endurance of the garrison by constant
harassment, but not directly reduce the works themselves.
It is only just to say that his estimate of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
effect of the horizontal fire upon the walls is more
favorable than that of the French engineers, who did
not consider that the damage done necessarily entailed
a capitulation; but seamen and engineers have
rarely agreed in their opinions upon this subject.</p>

<p>The same zeal which led Farragut to this minute
inspection of the battered fortress carried him also
on board one of the French ships, while she still remained
cleared for action, to note matters of detail
which differed from those then prevalent in his own
service. Of these he made a very full representation,
and one much in disparagement of the United
States Navy; which, since the glories of 1812 and
the first re-organization and development procured
for it by the popular favor consequent upon its victories,
had been allowed to drop into a state of backwardness,
as regards the material, similar to that
which followed the Civil War, and from which it is
but now beginning to emerge. The points which he
noted, though most important to that rapidity and
order upon which the efficient service of a ship's batteries
depends, would have now no attraction for
the unprofessional reader; nor for the professional,
except as matters of antiquarian interest. They
showed that spirit of system, of scientific calculation,
of careful adaptation of means to ends, which have
ever distinguished the French material for naval
war, except when the embarrassments of the treasury
have prevented the adoption of expensive improvements&mdash;a
spirit which for over a century made the
French ships the models which their usually victorious
rivals were fain to copy. "The English and
ourselves may affect to despise the French by sea,"
wrote Farragut to Barron, "but depend upon it, sir,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
they are in science far ahead of us both, and when
England next meets France upon the ocean she will
find a different enemy from that of the last war.
Of all this I know you have seen much in theory,
but I have seen it tested in practice."</p>

<p>The substance of Farragut's letter to Barron
deals with matters which the progress of time and
the accompanying advances in naval science have
now made obsolete; but the spirit which inspired
the letter and accumulated the materials for it can
never become obsolete. It was then, and it is now,
the indication of a man keeping abreast of his time
and awake to its necessities; it held then, as it does
now, the promise of one who, when occasion arose,
would have his faculties in readiness, by constant
training, to exert all the powers with which nature
had gifted him. The conditions of 1861 were very
different from those of 1838; but the officer who
was found awake to the first in their day would not
be behind the others in theirs. The letter concluded
with a pregnant observation, which deserves to be
quoted as thoroughly characteristic of the writer:
"I have already said too much for a letter to any
other person of your rank; but I flatter myself that
I know your love of improvement, and that my intentions
will be duly appreciated. If we who wander
about the world do not keep those at home informed
of the daily improvements in other navies,
how can we hope to improve, particularly when we
see men impressed with the idea that because they
once gained a victory, they can do it again? So
they may, but I can tell them it must be with the
means of 1838, and not those of 1812." This transmission
of information concerning the progress of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
other navies, upon which Farragut laid such just
stress, is now systematized and perfected under a
particular branch of the Navy Department, known
as the Office of Naval Intelligence. Upon every
ship afloat there is an officer whose duty is to observe
and report to that office upon such matters,
and upon all the experiences of foreign navies which
are open to the examination of outsiders.</p>

<p>After the French affair at Vera Cruz the Erie
returned to Pensacola, and there on the 12th of
January, 1839, Farragut gave up the command to an
officer of senior rank and went home. Upon his
arrival in Norfolk, finding his wife's health to be
very precarious, he remained unemployed until her
death, which occurred on the 27th of December,
1840. "No more striking illustration of his gentleness
of character," says his biography by his son,
"is shown than in Farragut's attention to his invalid
wife. His tenderness in contributing to her every
comfort, and catering to every whim, through sixteen
years of suffering, forms one of the brightest
spots in the history of his domestic life. When not
at sea, he was constantly by her side, and proved
himself a faithful and skillful nurse. It was the subject
of remark by all who were thrown with him; and
a lady of Norfolk said, 'When Captain Farragut dies,
he should have a monument reaching to the skies,
made by every wife in the city contributing a stone.'"</p>

<h3>COMMANDER AND CAPTAIN.<br /><br />

1841-1860.</h3>


<p>Immediately after the death of his wife Farragut
applied for sea service; and on the 22d of February,
1841, he was ordered to the Delaware, a ship-of-the-line,
which was fitting for sea in Norfolk and destined
to take him for the third time to the Brazil
station. He was then among the senior lieutenants
of the navy; but as it was in accordance with custom
that a commander should be the executive officer
of a ship-of-the-line, his expected promotion would
not, when it arrived, cause him to leave his position.
Some time passed before the Delaware was fully
ready for sea. Before sailing, she was sent up the
Chesapeake to the mouth of the Severn River, where
she was visited by numbers of people from the neighboring
city of Annapolis, as well as by large parties
of congressmen and public officials from Washington,
among whom came the then Secretary of the Navy.
It was while lying off Annapolis, on the 27th of September,
1841, that Farragut received his commission
as commander in the navy. His seniority as such
was from September 8, 1841. A few days later the
Delaware returned to Hampton Roads, and thence
sailed for her station on the 1st of November. On<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the 12th of January she anchored in Rio Janeiro.
After a stay of six weeks there, the whole squadron
sailed for the Rio de la Plata, the usual resort of the
ships on that station during the summer months of
the southern hemisphere, when the yellow fever is apt
to be prevalent in Rio Janeiro. On the 1st of June,
1842, Farragut was ordered to command the Decatur,
a small sloop-of-war, relieving Commander Henry
W. Ogden; who as a midshipman of the Essex had
been his messmate nearly thirty years before, and
was now compelled to leave his ship by an illness
which never allowed him to resume the active pursuit
of his profession. The transfer of the command
appears to have been made in the harbor of Rio Janeiro.
In severing his connection with the Delaware,
with his new rank, Farragut felt that he had parted
finally with the subordinate duties of his calling;
and, as rarely happens, he passed directly from the
active exercise of the lower position to fill the higher.
His journal records the fact with a characteristic
comment: "Thus closed my service on board the
Delaware as executive officer; to which I shall always
look back with gratification, as it was the last
step in the ladder of subordinate duties, and I feel
proud to think I performed it with the same zeal as
the first." He was then nearly forty-one years old.</p>

<p>On the 2d of July the Decatur sailed for the La
Plata in company with the Delaware. Soon after
reaching Montevideo, Commodore Morris embarked
on board the former, and went in her to Buenos
Ayres; ships of the size of the Delaware not being
able to approach that city on account of the great
distance to which very shoal water extends from
it. After exchanging the usual official civilities and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
transacting some business with Rosas, who then embodied
in his own person all the powers of the state,
the commodore returned to Montevideo; but the
Decatur was soon sent back, and Farragut spent
most of the latter half of 1842 at Buenos Ayres, in
constant intercourse, both official and social, with
Rosas and his family. Of the latter he, in common
with most American naval officers who visited the
La Plata at that time, received very agreeable impressions;
and since, as commanding officer, his duties
were less exacting and his time much more at
his own command than as executive, he gave free
play to the social disposition which was prominent
in his character. Much of his journal during his
stay is taken up with the accounts of social and official
entertainments in which he shared. "During
the month of September," he writes, "I made it a
rule to spend two or three evenings a week at the
governor's" (Rosas). "On the 5th of November I
was invited to a ball at the Victoria Theatre, where,
as on all similar occasions, I danced the first quadrille
with the charming 'Manuelita," the daughter of
Rosas. The pleasant and familiar relations thus established
enabled him to do many kind acts for the
Unitarios, whose lives were in constant danger by
political accusations, if not from actual offenses.</p>

<p>Rosas himself was then in the full exercise of the
dictatorial power with which he had been invested
some years before, after refusing a re-election as
governor of Buenos Ayres. His rule, which lasted
under successive renewals of his office until 1852, was
arbitrary and bloody; but in the disorganized condition
of the provinces at that period a man of his
force of character seems to have been necessary, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
avert the greater horrors of constant intestine strife.
"We concluded from our observations," notes Farragut
in his journal, "that he was a man of uncommon
mind and energy, and, as a general thing, reasonable;
but on the subject of secret societies he was a
madman, if we might judge from his furious denunciation
of them." They constituted, indeed, the one
resource of the cowed Unitarios, and were the chief
danger then threatening him. "We had an excellent
opportunity to form an idea of his character, as he
appeared to throw off all restraint while with us.
But the commodore informed us that, as soon as he
laid business matters before him, Rosas was a different
person; he was calm and measured in manner
and language." The ladies of the family were amiable,
intelligent and hospitable; but, like all the
women of Buenos Ayres at that time, were perforce
ardent Federalists and detesters of the "savage
Unitarios." Farragut mentions an incident occurring
at an official festivity in honor of Rosas, which
shows the savagery that lay close under the surface
of the Argentine character at that time, and easily
found revolting expression in the constant civil
strife and in the uncontrolled rule of the dictator.
"In the ball-room was a picture which would have
disgraced even barbarian society. It was a full-sized
figure representing a Federal soldier, with a
Unitarian lying on the ground, the Federal pressing
his knees between the victim's shoulders, whose head
was pulled back with the left hand, and the throat
cut from ear to ear, while the executioner exultingly
held aloft a bloody knife and seemed to be claiming
the applause of the spectators. I am sure I do not
err in saying that every one of our party felt an in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>voluntary
shudder come over him when his eye fell
upon this tableau; nor did we afterward recover our
spirits, everything in the way of gayety on our part
during the night was forced and unnatural."</p>

<p>It is a matter of some, though minor, interest to
note that Farragut has occasion at this time to mention
Garibaldi, in connection with the wars then waging.
The Italian patriot, whose name was then far
from having the celebrity it has since attained, had
for some time been engaged on the popular side in
revolutionary struggles in the southern provinces of
Brazil. Thence he had passed into Uruguay, and
become a teacher of mathematics in Montevideo.
Rosas had the ambition to bring into the Argentine
confederation all the provinces which once formed
the viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres, of which Uruguay
was one; and, finding a pretext in the civil dissensions
of the latter, had opened hostilities as the ally
of one party in the State. Garibaldi, who began life
as a seaman, had command of the Uruguayan naval
forces, and in that capacity undertook to carry stores
to Corrientes, an important point far up the river
Parana. "As he met with many obstacles in his
course," notes Farragut, "the Argentine admiral,
Brown, was enabled to overtake him. Garibaldi ran
his vessel into a creek and made a most desperate
resistance; fought until he had expended everything
in the way of ammunition, then landed his crew and
set his vessel on fire." On the 17th of October a
grand ball was given in honor of this success, which
Commander Farragut attended; as he did all the
other gayeties during his stay in Buenos Ayres.</p>

<p>The Decatur had already been long on the station
when Farragut assumed command, and the time had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
now arrived for her to return home. After leaving
Buenos Ayres she made short stops at Montevideo,
Rio Janeiro, Maranham, and Para, the latter being
the seaport of the Amazon River. On the 18th of
February, 1843, she arrived in Norfolk, and Farragut
was relieved. His health being delicate at this time,
he spent the following summer at Fauquier Springs,
Virginia.</p>

<p>From the mountains he returned in the autumn to
Norfolk; and there on the 26th of December, 1843,
he married Miss Virginia Loyall, the eldest daughter
of Mr. William Loyall, a well-known and respected
citizen of Norfolk.</p>

<p>In April, 1844, Commander Farragut was ordered
as executive officer to the receiving ship at Norfolk,
the Pennsylvania, of one hundred and twenty
guns; which, in the days of sailing ships, was by far
the largest vessel the United States ever had, and
one of the largest in the world. Some time later he
was transferred to the navy yard at the same place,
on which duty he was employed when the war with
Mexico arose.</p>

<p>As soon as the already existing difficulties with
that country began to wear an ominous outlook, Farragut
wrote to the Navy Department, asking for service
in the Gulf. In his application he stated the qualifications
he thought he possessed, from his knowledge
and close study of the ground, and from his acquaintance
with the Spanish language. He instanced
particularly the occasions on which he had
been employed in that neighborhood, and the close
study he had been privileged to make on the spot
during Admiral Baudin's operations. Although the
Secretary of the Navy at that time was the able and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
enlightened Mr. George Bancroft, this letter received
no reply; and a second, sent after the beginning of
the war, was barely acknowledged without any action
being taken. After Mr. Bancroft left the Department,
Farragut renewed his application, expressing
a decided opinion that the castle of San Juan de
Ulloa could be taken either by artillery attack or by
escalade; offering to undertake the task with the
Pennsylvania and two sloops-of-war. If not thought
to have rank enough for such a command, he was
willing to go back to the position of executive officer
of the Pennsylvania, in order, in that capacity, to
organize the crew for the attack. The opinion thus
expressed ran counter to the routine prejudices of
the day, and, coming from an officer who had as yet
had no opportunity to establish his particular claim
to be heard, rather hurt than improved his chances
for employment. It was not till February, 1847,
nearly a year after the war began, and then with
"much difficulty," that he obtained command of the
sloop-of-war Saratoga; but when he reached Vera
Cruz in her, the castle had already passed into the
hands of the United States, having surrendered to
the forces under General Scott on the 26th of March.
That this capture should have been made by the
army rather than by the navy was a severe disappointment
to Farragut, who had so long cherished
the hope that its fall should have been the brilliant
achievement of his own service. In his mortification
he used an expression which, in the light of his own
subsequent career, seems a twofold prophecy. "The
navy would stand on a different footing to-day if our
ships had made the attack. It was all we could do,
and should have been done at all hazards. Commo<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>dore
Conner thought differently, however, and the
old officers at home backed his opinion; but they all
paid the penalty&mdash;<i>not one of them will wear an admiral's
flag</i>, which they might have done if that castle
had been taken by the navy, which must have been
the result of an attack." It was to such enterprise
at the hands of the men of his own time, among
whom he was foremost, that the navy at a later
day did obtain the admiral's flag which it had so
long in vain desired.</p>

<p>The frustration of this high ambition was not the
only misfortune to Farragut arising out of the Mexican
war. He contracted the yellow fever on the
station, nearly losing his life; and subsequently became
involved in a controversy with the commodore
of the squadron, who he believed had, in the assignment
of duty, treated him and his ship with unfair
discrimination, due to personal ill-will toward himself.
The correspondence had no results; but such
quarrels are rarely other than hurtful to the junior
officer engaged. It is not singular, therefore, that
he speaks of this cruise as the most mortifying of all
the service he had seen since entering the navy. "I
have little," he said again, "to look back to with
satisfaction or pleasure at this time, except the consciousness
of having done my duty." Smarting under
the belief that he was being imposed upon, he wrote
to the Navy Department complaining of injustice, and
asking that either he himself should be relieved or
the ship sent home. He candidly admits that his
letters were considered improper by the Secretary of
the Navy, but the Saratoga was ordered to return to
the United States, and was paid off at New York in
February, 1848. In her short cruise there had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
one hundred cases of yellow fever in her crew of one
hundred and fifty, and her commander had been
obliged, to use his own expression, "to rid the service"
of five of her junior officers, and on the last day
to bring the first lieutenant to trial for drunkenness.
Altogether, the Mexican war and the cruise of the
Saratoga seem to have marked the lowest point of
disappointment and annoyance that Farragut was
called upon to encounter during his naval career.</p>

<p>Immediately after leaving the Saratoga, Farragut
was again ordered to duty in his former position at
the Norfolk navy yard. Two years later he was
called to Washington to draw up, in connection with
some other officers, a book of Ordnance Regulations
for the navy. This occupied him for eighteen
months. As when in New Haven, twenty-five years
before, he had improved the opportunity of hearing
the lectures at Yale College, so at this later period he
attended regularly those of the Smithsonian Institution,
losing, he records, but a single one. "You will
rarely come away from such lectures," he adds,
"without being somewhat wiser than you went in."
Where precisely such knowledge might come into
play he could not, indeed, foresee, but he acted always
on the principle that any knowledge might at some
time become useful; just as, when at Vera Cruz,
though he did not at the time look forward to a war
with Mexico, he closely examined every point of interest,
for "I have made it a rule of my life to note
these things with a view to the possible future."</p>

<p>When the Ordnance Regulations were finished,
in the spring of 1852, Farragut was again assigned
to the Norfolk navy yard, and directed to utilize the
experience he had gained in compiling them by giving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
weekly lectures on gunnery to the officers on the
station. In prosecution of the same line of professional
work, he was soon after ordered to conduct a
series of experiments at Old Point Comfort, near
Norfolk, to determine certain questions connected
with the endurance of iron cannon; the discharges
being continued with one or two of each class of
service guns until they burst. Some very important
results were obtained; but the circumstance connected
with this duty which has now most interest,
is that in it Farragut was associated with Lieutenant
Percival Drayton, who was afterward his flag-captain
and chief-of-staff at the battle of Mobile Bay. The
intimacy formed during this year of experimental
duty at Old Point lasted throughout their lives.</p>

<p>Soon after this the Crimean war broke out. Farragut's
desire for his own professional improvement
and for the progress of the service led him to make
application to the Navy Department to be sent to the
seat of war, "to visit the fleets of England and France,
and ascertain whether in the outfits and preparation
for war they possess any advantages over our own
ships-of-war, and, if so, in what they consist." The
utility of such a mission can not be doubted, and his
occupations of the past few years particularly prepared
him for such an inquiry. Had the Navy Department
then had any systematic record of the
aptitude shown by individual officers, and of the work
done by them, it must have recognized Farragut's
peculiar fitness for duties of this kind; which have
since his time been organized and given a most comprehensive
scope under the Intelligence Office of the
Navy Department. As it was, his application received
no other reply than a polite acknowledgment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
A commission, consisting of three officers of the Engineer
Corps of the army, was sent by the War Department
to visit Europe and the seat of war, and
upon its return made an elaborate report; but at this
critical period of naval progress, when sail was manifestly
giving place to steam, when the early attempts
at iron-clad batteries were being made, and the vast
changes in armament that have since taken place
were certainly, though as yet dimly, indicated, it did
not appear to the Government of the United States
a matter of sufficient importance to inquire, on the
spot, into the practical working of the new instruments
under the test of war.</p>

<p>Although doubtless not so intended, the Navy
Department emphasized its decision not to send Farragut
to the East by assigning him to duty as far
west as the naval interests of the United States, within
its own borders, then allowed. In August, 1854,
four months after his application for the former employment,
he was ordered to California as first commandant
of the navy yard at Mare Island. The site
had been selected in the year 1852 by a commission
of three officers, but as yet no navy yard existed. It
was to be Farragut's particular duty to plan and
build it up under the general instructions of the Department.
His selection for this difficult and onerous,
but at the same time very flattering, appointment
was among the first evident results of the diligent,
painstaking effort which had marked his professional
career. By that, and by that only, had he as yet had
any opportunity of marking himself above the ordinary
run of men; but he stood high in the esteem
of Commodore Joseph Smith, then and for many
years both before and after, the chief of the Bureau<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
of Yards and Docks, under whose charge the management
and development of navy yards more particularly
came. At the critical period when the
selection of an officer to command in the attack upon
New Orleans had to be made, Smith, who had close
confidential relations with the Secretary of the Navy,
always held that Farragut was the man above all
others for the place.</p>

<p>The site of the new yard was in the extensive
sheet of inland waters connected with the bay of
San Francisco, and some thirty miles from the city.
There being no accommodations upon the island,
Farragut, with his family, for some seven months
lived on board an old sloop-of-war anchored near by.
He remained at this station for four years, during
which great progress was made in the development
of the yard; but the duty, though most important
and particularly responsible, because of the length
of time required by correspondence to pass to and
from Washington, was not fruitful of incident. These
were the troublous early times of California&mdash;the days
of the Vigilance Committee and the Law and Order
Party. With these intestine troubles of a State the
military officers of the United States had no proper
concern; but there was continually a possibility that
they might be forced to take a stand by the interference
of one side or the other with civil officials of
the United States Government, or might be induced,
by a request from the authorities, to act upon the
ground that there was no time to refer to Washington
for instructions. It is unnecessary to enter into
any examination of Farragut's course during this
period, although the affairs with which he had to deal
became at times both critical and delicate. It will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
be sufficient to say that the Navy Department, after
receiving his reports, approved his conduct as having
been prudent and yet marked by a proper spirit.</p>

<p>In July, 1858, Farragut returned to the East by
the only route then available, the Isthmus of Panama.
During his absence, on the 14th of September,
1855, he had been promoted to the rank of captain,
which, prior to the Civil War, was the highest grade
in the United States Navy; the title commodore,
then so frequently applied to the older officers of the
service, being simply one of courtesy given to a captain
who had commanded a squadron of several
vessels, but who did not thereby cease to be borne
as a captain upon the Navy Register. Soon after his
arrival Farragut was ordered to command the Brooklyn,
one of six steam sloops-of-war just being completed.
She belonged to that new navy of thirty
years ago which the United States Government,
most luckily for itself, had determined to build, and
which became fairly available just in time for the
exigencies of the Civil War.</p>

<p>It has been said, and that on the floors of Congress
by a politician conspicuous in his party, that past history
teaches that preparation for war is unnecessary to
the United States, and the conditions precedent to the
wars of 1812 and 1861 have been cited in support of
the assertion. Certainly no one cognizant of the facts
will deny that the United States was most miserably
unprepared for either war as regards the size of her
navy; but it so happened on both occasions, more by
good luck than good management, that what navy it
did have was of remarkably fine quality, and, to the
extent to which its numbers permitted it to be employed,
was generally perfectly adequate to the work<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
it had to do. It could not, however, begin to touch
the full amount of service it ought to have done. In
1812 it could not protect the Chesapeake nor the
Mississippi; it was blockaded in its own ports, escaping
only by evasion; it could not protect American
commerce, which suffered more than did that of
Great Britain. In 1861, had its numbers been at all
adequate, it could by prompt action have forestalled
the preparations of the enemy, and by prevention
secured immediate advantages which were afterward
achieved only by large expenditure of time and fighting.
Such were the results of unpreparedness. It
was to the preparation, scanty as it was&mdash;to the fine
ships and superior armaments, both too few&mdash;that the
successes of either era were due. The frigates and
sloops of 1812 were among the finest of their class to
be found anywhere, with powerful batteries and excellently
officered; while in the decade before the
Civil War began there had been built eighteen or
twenty new steamships, admirably efficient for their
day, and with armaments of an advanced and powerful
type. Upon these fell the principal brunt of the
naval fighting that ensued. These ships, and particularly
those of the Brooklyn class, were the backbone
of Farragut's fleet throughout all his actions,
even in the last at Mobile in 1864. Had there been
thrice as many, the work would have been sooner and
therefore more cheaply done; but had the lack of
preparation in 1861 equaled that of 1851 or 1881, it
may be questioned whether any of his successes could
have been won.</p>

<p>When Farragut took command of the Brooklyn,
ten years had elapsed since he was last afloat&mdash;years
pregnant with naval change. He had never before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
served in a steamer, except for a very short time in
a primitive one belonging to Porter's Mosquito fleet,
in 1823. The changes in the disposition and handling
of the guns had not been radical. They were
still arranged "in broadside," along the two sides of
the vessel; nor were the pivot guns&mdash;which, as their
name implies, could be pivoted to one side or the
other, according to the position of an enemy&mdash;a new
idea. In these matters there had been improvement
and development, but not revolution. But while the
mode of placing and handling was essentially the
same, the guns themselves had greatly increased in
size and received important modifications in pattern.
The system then in vogue was that associated with
the name of the late Admiral Dahlgren. The shape
of the gun had been made to conform to the strains
brought by the discharge upon its various parts, as
determined by careful experiment; and in place of
the 32-pounder, or six-inch gun, which had been the
principal weapon of the earlier ships, the batteries of
the new frigates and sloops were composed chiefly of
nine-inch guns, with one or more pivots of ten- or
eleven-inch bore. The shell-shot, whose destructive
effects had excited Farragut's comments in 1838, were
now the recognized type of projectile; and the new
guns were spoken of distinctively as shell-guns, because
not expected to use solid shot under ordinary
circumstances. The Brooklyn and her fellows, among
which was Farragut's future flag-ship, the Hartford,
although screw steamers, had also the full sail power
of the former sailing ship; and they were wooden,
not iron vessels.</p>

<p>The service of the Brooklyn, while under Farragut's
command, was chiefly confined to his old cruis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>ing
ground in the West Indies and in Mexico. In
the latter country, since the termination of the war
with the United States in 1848, there had been a
constant succession of revolutions; and at the time
of the Brooklyn's cruise there was established in
Vera Cruz a constitutional party, at whose head was
Benito Juarez, the lawful claimant of the presidency.
Opposed to this, in the city of Mexico, was the party
headed by General Miramon, who had succeeded by
force to the authority of Juarez's predecessor. The
United States threw its influence on the side of
Juarez; and its minister, Robert McLane, was permitted
to use the Brooklyn to carry him from point
to point of the coast. While no force was exerted,
the support given to the minister's remonstrances
by the constant presence of a powerful ship-of-war
served to emphasize the policy of the Government,
which had recognized Juarez. This recognition was
followed some time later by a similar step on the
part of the ministers of England, France, and Spain.
Mr. McLane continued with the Brooklyn during
great part of 1859, and in December of that year returned
in her to the Mississippi, where he was landed
at a plantation below New Orleans. This visit to
his early home was marked by a sad coincidence to
Farragut. His elder brother, William, a lieutenant
in the navy, had long been retired from active service,
for which he was unfitted by rheumatism. In
consequence he had not received promotion, remaining
at the head of the list of lieutenants, and being
assigned to duty at the naval rendezvous in New
Orleans. When the Brooklyn entered the river he
was lying at the point of death, but heard of his
brother's approach, and expressed a hope that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
might live long enough to see him again after so
many years of separation. The wish was not to be
fulfilled. Though ignorant of the danger, Captain
Farragut hastened to the city, himself also looking
forward with pleasure to the meeting; but he arrived
only in time to see his brother dead, and to
follow him to the grave.</p>

<p>Farragut remained attached to the Brooklyn for
two years. In October, 1860, he was relieved by
Captain W. S. Walker, and returned to his home in
Norfolk. This ended his sea service prior to the
Civil War, and as the captain of a single ship.
Thenceforward, during the brief but important remnant
of his active career, he was to command great
fleets.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE QUESTION OF ALLEGIANCE.<br /><br />

1860-1861.</h3>


<p>When Captain Farragut returned to Norfolk in
October, 1860, he was, albeit unconsciously, rapidly
approaching the turning point of his life, the tide in
his affairs which taken at the flood should lead on
to fortune. That he seized the opportunity was due to
no dexterous weighing of the effects of either course
upon his personal future, but to that preparedness of
mind which has already been mentioned as one of
his characteristic traits, and to the tenacity with
which were held his convictions thus deliberately
and maturely formed. For several years he had
watched with unquiet mind the gathering clouds
which preceded the approaching storm, and in common
with others had felt the distress and perplexity
which would attend the rupture of the Union. He
did not, however, remain a merely passive spectator,
agitated as such by hopes and fears, but trusting
withal to the chapter of accidents. He had considered
the effect of the alternatives before the
country, and what his own duty should be in any
case. He could not, in his modest position, control
the course of events; but, whatever befell, he would
be ready to take his stand, strengthened in so doing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
by the settled principles to which his conscientious
meditation had led him. Thus his fixed purpose, enlightened
by reason, had in it nothing of obstinacy;
yet resisted those appeals to affection, to interest, or
to prejudice, under which so many succumbed.</p>

<p>Within a month after his leaving the Brooklyn,
on the 6th of November, 1860, the presidential election
was held, and resulted, as had been expected, in
the choice of Mr. Lincoln. On the 20th of December
South Carolina seceded, and her course was followed
within the next six weeks by the other cotton
States. In February, 1861, delegates from these
States met in convention at Montgomery, Alabama,
adopted a constitution, and elected Jefferson Davis
to be president of their confederation. On the 18th
he was inaugurated, and the new government was
thus formally constituted.</p>

<p>Here for a moment the secession movement
paused, and Farragut earnestly trusted would stop.
Born in a Southern State, and passing his childhood
in the extreme Southwest, his relations with both had
been severed at too early an age to establish any
lasting hold upon his affections; but, though he was
to the end carried upon the Navy Register as a citizen
of Tennessee, the tenderest and most enduring
ties of his life had been formed in Virginia. Nowhere
were local bonds stronger, nowhere State pride
greater or more justified, than in the famous Commonwealth,
which had stood in the center of the line in
the struggle for independence, and had given to the
nation so many illustrious men from Washington
downward. It was impossible that Farragut&mdash;who at
so early an age, and when attached to no other spot,
had married in Norfolk, and thenceforward gone in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
and out among its people&mdash;should be insensible to
these influences, or look without grief to a contingency
which should force him to sunder all these
associations and go forth, on the verge of old age,
to seek elsewhere a new home. Nor is it possible
to many, however conscious of right, to bear without
suffering the alienation and the contempt visited
upon those who, in times of keen political excitement,
dare to differ from the general passion which
sways the mass around them.</p>

<p>Farragut therefore naturally hoped that this bitter
trial might be spared him. The Virginian people
had taken what seemed then to be a conservative
attitude; and, although he was determined to abide
by the Union if it were severed by violent action, he
was anxious to believe that his home might be saved
to him. The Legislature of the State met early in
January and recommended all the States to appoint
deputies to a peace convention, which accordingly
met on the 4th of February; but the propositions
made by it were not such as the National Congress
could accept. On the 13th of the same month there
was assembled at Richmond a State convention,
the majority of the delegates to which were Union
men, in the then sense of the word in that State.
This fact, and the character of some of the speeches
made, tended to encourage the belief to which Farragut's
wishes led him; but this hope was soon damped
by the passage of resolutions affirming the right of
secession, and defining the grounds upon which Virginia
would be justified in exercising the right.
Among these grounds were the adoption of any
warlike measures by the United States Government,
the recapture of the forts which had been seized by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the States already seceded, or any attempt to exact
duties from them. True, this was followed during
the first week in April by the rejection of a proposition
to secede by a vote of eighty-nine to forty-five;
but, as Farragut held that the President would be
justified in calling out troops when the forts and
property of the nation had been violently taken from
it, the contrary avowal of the Legislature of his State
showed that he might soon be forced to choose between
it and the National Government. In that case
his mind was fully made up; the choice was painful,
but not doubtful. "God forbid," he said, "that I
should have to raise my hand against the South!"
but the words themselves showed that, however bitter
the decision, he was ready to make it. If separation
between the sections came peacefully, by mutual
consent, he would abide in the only home his manhood
had known, and cast his lot thenceforth with
the people to whom he was allied and among whom
his interests lay; but if the rupture took the form
of violent rebellion against the Central Government,
whose claims he admitted and to which he owned
allegiance, he was prepared to turn his arms even
against those who in the other alternative would
have been his countrymen. The attitude thus held
during those long months of suspense and anxiety
was honorable alike to his heart, which responded
warmly to the calls of natural affection, and to his
conscience, which subordinated the dictates of the
heart to his convictions of right; while the unhesitating
character of his resolution, amid the uncertainties
that unsettled so many men, must be
attributed to that habit of preparing for emergencies
which characterized his career.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 12th of April, 1861, the long period of
waiting and watching was brought to an end by the
attack upon Fort Sumter. On the 15th President
Lincoln issued his proclamation formally announcing
the condition of affairs which existed in the seceded
States, the defiance of the Central Government, and
the seizure of its property. In consequence he called
for seventy-five thousand men from the militia of
the various States, and avowed clearly that "the
first service assigned to the forces hereby called
forth will probably be to repossess the forts, places,
and property which have been seized from the Union."
This was clearly an appeal to arms, provoked finally
by the assault upon Fort Sumter, but which the convention
then sitting in Richmond had pronounced to
be a lawful cause for secession. In the excitement
of the hour the Union men, whose attitude toward
the more violent party had been almost apologetic,
were swept away by the current of feeling, and an
ordinance of secession was passed by the convention
on the 17th of April, 1861.</p>

<p>During the previous winter Farragut had been
residing in Norfolk, unemployed by the Government,
but in daily association both with citizens and naval
officers; many of whom, like himself, were married
and settled there. He and his friends met daily at
one of those common rendezvous which are to be
found in every small town, and there discussed the
news which each day brought of change and excitement.
In this way Farragut became acquainted with
the views of most of the resident officers, and realized,
without being himself swayed by, the influences
to which all of them, and especially those of Southern
birth, were subjected. With the conservatism com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>mon
in seamen who have been for long periods separated
by their profession from their native places,
the great majority of these officers, already men of
middle age, could not but feel keen sorrow at the
prospect of changes, which would remove them from
the navy and separate them from the flag which had
hitherto stood to them for country. But, moved by
feeling and prejudice, wrought upon by the strong
appeals of those they loved, and unfortified by the
well-reasoned convictions which made the strength
of Farragut, it was equally impossible for the greater
part of them to imitate his example. The sense of
duty and official honor which they owed to their long
training in a generous service stood by them, and
few were the cases of men false to trusts actually in
their charge; but theirs was not that sense of personal
allegiance to the Government which gave the
light of the single eye, and enabled Farragut's final
decision to be as prompt as it was absolute.</p>

<p>On the 18th of April, the day after the ordinance
of secession had been passed, Farragut went as usual
to the place of meeting, and saw, immediately upon
entering, by the faces of those there, that a great
change had passed over the relations between them.
He spoke with his usual openness, and expressed his
deliberate convictions. He did not believe that the
action of the convention represented the sober judgment
of the people. The State had been, as he
phrased it, "dragooned" out of the Union; and
President Lincoln was perfectly justified in calling
for troops after the seizure of the forts and arsenals.
One of those present remarked impatiently that a
person with such sentiments could not live in Norfolk,
and this feeling was evidently shared by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
bystanders; there was, indeed, some danger, in those
excited moments, of personal violence to those who
dared gainsay the popular passion. "Very well," replied
Farragut, "I can live somewhere else." No
time was needed to take a decision already contingently
formed, and for executing which he had, with
his customary foresight, been accumulating the necessary
funds. He at once went to his house and told
his wife the time had come for her to decide whether
she would remain with her own kinsfolk or follow
him North. Her choice was as instant as his own,
and that evening they, with their only son, left Norfolk,
never to return to it as their home. Mrs. Farragut's
sister and her young family accompanied
them in the steamer to Baltimore. Upon reaching
the latter city they found it also boiling over with
excitement. The attack upon the Massachusetts
troops had just taken place, and the railroad bridges
over the Susquehanna were then burning. The usual
means of communication being thus broken off, Farragut
and his party had to take passage for Philadelphia
in a canal boat, on which were crowded some
three hundred passengers, many of them refugees
like themselves. It is a curious illustration of the
hardships attending a flight under such exigency,
even in so rich a country as our own, that a baby in
the company had to be fed on biscuit steeped in
brandy for want of proper nourishment.</p>

<p>From Philadelphia the journey to New York was
easy, and Farragut there settled his family in a small
cottage in the village of Hastings, on the Hudson
River. Here he awaited events, hoping for employment;
but it is one of the cruel circumstances attending
civil strife that confidence is shaken, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
suspicions that arise, however unjust, defy reason and
constrain the Government to defer to them. No man
could have given stronger proof than Farragut had
of his perfect loyalty; but all shades of opinion were
known to exist among officers of Southern origin,
even when they remained in the service, and there
were those who, though refusing to follow the South,
would willingly have avoided striking a blow against
the seceding States. Men were heard to say that
they would not go with their State, but neither
would they fight against her; or that they would
remain in the navy, but seek employment that might
spare them the pain of taking part in such a contest.
These illogical positions were soon abandoned as the
spirit of war gained more and more hold upon the
feelings of men, but for Farragut they never existed
after the first blow was struck. Through whatever
struggles with himself he may have passed in the
earlier stages of the secession movement, his decision,
when reached, admitted no half-measures, nor
halted between two opinions. "He stood on no
neutral ground, he longed to take an active part in
the war." Nevertheless, the Government could not
at once accept, as a title to full and implicit confidence,
even the sacrifice of home and life-long associations
which he had made to the cause of the
Union. If given any duty, a man of Farragut's rank
and attainments must needs have one involving much
responsibility, failure in which would involve not
only himself but those who had employed him. The
cry of treachery was sure to follow, and prudent
officers of Southern birth found it advisable to decline
employments where they foresaw that delays were
unavoidable, because they felt that what might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
explained in the case of a Northern man would in
them be stamped by public opinion as the result of
disaffection. In Hastings and its neighborhood the
most grotesque suspicions were spread concerning
the Southern captain who had thus come to dwell
among them, and who, for conscience and country,
had given up more than had been demanded of those
who thus distrusted him. Time was needed to allow
men's minds to reach a more reasonable frame, and
for the Government itself to sift and test, not merely
the fidelity, but the heartiness and the probable capacity
of the officers at its command.</p>

<p>Farragut's first employment was as a member of
a board to recommend officers for retirement from
active service, under an act approved August 3,
1861. The object of this act was to assist the Department
in the discrimination necessary to be made
between the competent and those disabled by years
or infirmity, for up to that time there had been no
regular system of retirement, and men were retained
on the active list past the period of efficiency, because
no provision for removing them existed. The
duty, though most important with war actually existing,
was delicate and trying, and far from consonant
to Farragut's active, enterprising character. More
suitable employment was, however, fast approaching.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_i" id="Page_i">[i]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE NEW ORLEANS EXPEDITION.<br /><br />
1862.</h3>


<p>The necessity of controlling the Mississippi valley
had been early realized by the United States
Government. In its hands the great stream would
become an impassable barrier between two large
sections of the Southern Confederacy; whereas in
the possession of the latter it remained a link binding
together all the regions through which it flowed,
or which were penetrated by any of its numerous
tributaries. The extensive territory west of the
river also produced a large part of the provisions
upon which depended the Southern armies, whose
main field of action was, nevertheless, on the eastern
side. In a country habitually so unprepared for war
as is the United States, and where, of course, such a
contingency as an intestine struggle between the
sections could not have been provided for, there
seemed room to hope that the national forces might
by rapid action seize the whole course of the river,
before the seceding States were able to take adequate
measures for its defense. The Government
had the support of that part of the country which
had received the largest manufacturing development,
and could, therefore, most quickly prepare the ma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>terial
for war, in which both sides were lamentably
deficient; and, what was yet more important, it possessed
in the new navy built since 1855 an efficient
weapon to which the South had nothing to oppose.
The hope was extravagant and doomed to disappointment;
for to overrun and hold so extensive a territory
as the immediate basin of the Mississippi required
a development of force on the one side and
a degree of exhaustion on the other which could
not be reached so early in the war. The relative
strengths, though unequal, were not yet sufficiently
disproportioned to enable the gigantic work to be
accomplished; and the principal result of an effort
undertaken without due consideration was to paralyze
a large fraction of a navy too small in numbers
to afford the detachment which was paraded gallantly,
but uselessly, above New Orleans. Nor was
this the worst; the time thus consumed in marching
up the hill in order at once to march down again
threw away the opportunity for reducing Mobile before
its defenses were strengthened. Had the navy
been large enough, both tasks might have been attempted;
but it will appear in the sequel that its
scanty numbers were the reason which postponed
the attack on Mobile from month to month, until it
became the most formidable danger Farragut ever
had to encounter.</p>

<p>Despite the extensive sea-coast of the United
States and the large maritime commerce possessed
by it at the opening of the war, the navy had never,
except for short and passing intervals, been regarded
with the interest its importance deserved. To this
had doubtless contributed the fixed policy of the
Government to concentrate its attention upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
internal development of the country, and to concern
itself little with external interests, except so far as
they promoted the views of that section which desired
to give extension to slaveholding territory.
The avoidance of entangling alliances had become
perverted to indifference to the means by which
alone, in the last resort, the nation can assert and
secure control in regions outside its borders, but
vitally affecting its prosperity and safety. The power
of navies was therefore, then as now, but little
understood. Consequently, when the importance of
the Mississippi Valley was realized, as it immediately
was, there was but one idea as to the means of controlling
it, and that was by a land invasion from the
great Western and Northwestern States. To this a
navy was indeed to be adjoined, but in a manner so
distinctly subsidiary that it was, contrary to all custom,
placed under the orders of the commander-in-chief
of the Western army, and became simply a division
of the land forces. From this subordinate
position it was soon raised by its own intrinsic value
and the logic of facts; but the transient experience
is noteworthy, because illustrating the general ignorance
of the country as to the powers of the
priceless weapon which lay ready, though unnoticed,
to its hand.</p>

<p>Happily, in the Navy Department itself juster
views prevailed; and the general indifference permitted
it at least one compensation&mdash;to follow its
own ways. The Secretary himself was not a professional
man, though he had had official connection
with the service in the past; but most fortunately
there was called to his assistance one who had been
for eighteen years in the navy, had passed while in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
it to the command of mail steamers, and only five
years before the war had resigned and entered civil
life. This gentleman, Mr. Gustavus V. Fox, thus
combined with business experience and an extensive
acquaintance with naval officers the capacities of a
seaman. He knew what ships could do and what
they could not; but to this common knowledge of
sea officers, gained by the daily habit of sea life, he
had added the results of study and reflection upon
events passing elsewhere than under his own observation.
The experiences of the allied navies in the
Crimean War had convinced him that, if the wooden
sides of ships could not be pitted in prolonged stand-up
fight against the stone walls of fortresses, they
were capable of enduring such battering as they might
receive in running by them through an unobstructed
channel. This conviction received support by the
results of the attacks upon Hatteras Inlet and Port
Royal. He might, indeed, have gone much further
back and confirmed his own judgment as a seaman
by the express opinion of an eminent soldier. Nearly
a hundred years before, Washington, at the siege of
Yorktown, had urged the French Admiral De Grasse
to send vessels past Cornwallis's works to control the
upper York River, saying: "I am so well satisfied by
experience of the little effect of land batteries on
vessels passing them with a leading breeze that, unless
the two channels near Yorktown should be found
impracticable by obstructions, I should have the
greatest confidence in the success of this important
service."<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>In this conviction of Mr. Fox's lay the inception<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
of the expedition against New Orleans. It was, in
his view, to be a purely naval attack. Once over
the bar at the mouth of the river, the channel as far
as the city had no natural obstruction, was clearly
defined, and easily followed, by day or night, without
a pilot. The heavy current of the early spring
months, while it would retard the passage of the
ships and so keep them longer under fire, would
make it difficult for the enemy to maintain in position
any artificial barrier placed by him. The
works to be passed&mdash;the seaward defenses of New
Orleans, Forts Jackson and St. Philip&mdash;were powerful
fortifications; but they were ultimately dependent
upon the city, ninety miles above them, for a support
which could come only by the river. A fleet anchored
above the forts lay across their only line of
communication, and when thus isolated, their fall
became only a question of time. The work proposed
to the United States Navy was, therefore, to
turn the forts by passing their fire, seize their line of
communications&mdash;the upper river&mdash;and their base,
New Orleans, and then to give over the latter to the
army, which engaged to furnish a force sufficient to
hold the conquest.</p>

<p>Having first taken the necessary, but strictly
preliminary, step of seizing as a depot Ship Island,
in Mississippi Sound, about a hundred miles from
the mouth of the river, Mr. Fox's proposition, which
had been adopted by the Secretary of the Navy, was
submitted to the President. Mr. Lincoln, himself a
Western man, unfamiliar with maritime matters and
engrossed with the idea of invasion from the north,
was disposed to be incredulous of success; but with
his usual open-mindedness consented to a full dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>cussion
before him by experts from both services.
A meeting was therefore held with General McClellan
at his headquarters. There were present, besides
the President, the Secretary of the Navy, Mr. Fox,
and Commander David D. Porter, who had recently
returned from service off the mouth of the Mississippi.
The antecedents of General McClellan were those of
an officer of the engineers, who are generally disposed
to exaggerate the powers of forts as compared
with ships, and to contemplate their reduction only
by regular approaches; just as an officer of the line
of the army, looking to the capture of a place like
New Orleans, will usually and most properly seek
first a base of operations, from which he will project
a campaign whose issue shall be the fall of the city.
To this cause was probably due the preference observed
by the Navy Department to exist in army
circles, for an attack upon Mobile first. Being close
to the sea, which was completely under the control
of the navy, the necessary land operations would
begin under far more favorable conditions, and could
be more easily maintained than in the alluvial soil of
the Mississippi delta. McClellan, who was an accomplished
master of his profession in all its branches,
received at first the impression that regular military
operations against New Orleans by way of the
river were being proposed to him, and demurred;
but, on learning that the only demand was for a force
to hold the city and surroundings in case of success,
he readily consented to detail ten or fifteen thousand
troops for the purpose. Though more hazardous,
the proposition of the Navy Department was in
principle strategically sound. The key of the position
was to be struck for at once, and the outlying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
defenses were expected then to fall by the severance
of their communications. The general might have
his own opinion as to the power of the navy to carry
out the proposed passage of the forts, and as to
whether its coal, when once above, would outlast the
endurance of the hostile garrisons; but those were
points upon which the Navy Department, which
undertook the risk, might be presumed to have more
accurate judgment than himself.</p>

<p>The conference, which was held about the middle
of November, 1861, resulted in the adoption of Mr.
Fox's plan in its main outlines; but with an important
addition, which threatened at one time to become
a very serious modification. Commander Porter suggested
that the naval vessels should be accompanied
by a mortar flotilla, to subdue the fire of the forts by
bombardment, and so to allow the fleet to pass without
risk, or with risk much diminished. This proposition
approved itself to the engineer instincts of
McClellan, and was adopted. The general then
designated Major Barnard, of the Engineer Corps, to
represent him in adjusting the details of the expedition.
Barnard also took strong ground in favor of
the mortars, and to this added the opinion&mdash;in which
Porter concurred&mdash;that the forts should be not merely
bombarded, but reduced before the passage. He
summed up his conclusions in the following perfectly
clear words: "To pass those works (merely) with a
fleet and appear before New Orleans is merely a raid&mdash;no
capture. New Orleans and the river can not
be held until communications are perfectly established."
The assertion of the last sentence can not
be denied; it admits of no difference of opinion.
The point in dispute between the two arguments was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
not this, but whether the fall of the city, which had
no local defenses, would entail that of the forts, and
so open the communications. Mr. Fox strongly held
that it would; but although he stuck to his opinion,
he had a deservedly high estimate of Porter's professional
ability&mdash;so much so that, had the latter's
rank justified, he would have urged him for the command
of the expedition. In this doubtful state of
the argument, it will be seen of how great importance
was the choice of the officer to be put in charge
of the whole undertaking. Had he also taken the
view of Barnard and Porter in favor of the more
cautious, but&mdash;as it proved&mdash;more dangerous course,
it could scarcely have failed that Fox would have
been overruled.</p>

<p>The nomination of this officer could not be longer
deferred. Secrecy and rapidity of action were large
elements in the hoped-for achievement, and secrecy
depends much upon the length of time the secret
must be kept. Among the officers whose length of
service and professional reputation indicated them as
suitable for the position, there was little to guide the
department to the man who would on emergency
show the audacity and self-reliance demanded by the
intended operations. The action proposed, though
it falls within the limits of the methods which history
has justified, and has, therefore, a legitimate place
in the so-called science of war, was, nevertheless,
as the opinions of Barnard and Porter show, contrary
to the more usual and accepted practice. It
disregarded the safeguards commonly insisted upon,
overleaped the successive steps by which military
achievement ordinarily advances to its end, and,
looking only to the exceptional conditions, resorted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
fearlessly to exceptional methods. For such a duty
the department needed a man of more than average
determination and vigor.</p>

<p>Farragut's name was necessarily among those considered;
but the final choice appears to have been determined
by the impression made upon Mr. Fox, and
through him upon the department, by his course in
leaving Norfolk at the time and in the way he did.
This, Fox argued, showed "great superiority of
character, clear perception of duty, and firm resolution
in the performance of it." His conspicuous
ability was not then recognized, could not be until
revealed by war; but it was evident that he stood
well above the common run of simply accomplished
officers. Still, further tests were required; in a matter
of so much importance the department had need
to move warily. That Farragut was faithful could
not be doubted; but was his heart so far in the contest
that he could be depended upon to exert his
abilities to the full? Commander Porter was ordered
to go to New York on duty connected with the mortar
flotilla, and while there to make an opportunity
to visit Farragut. There had been, as is known, a
close relation between the two families, and to him
Farragut was likely to show how hearty he was in
the cause. Porter's account was most favorable, and
it then remained only to judge whether he was in
sympathy with the military plan of the proposed expedition.</p>

<p>For this object Farragut was ordered to report
at the department, and Fox undertook to meet him
at the train and talk over the matter informally.
He arrived in Washington on the 21st of December,
was met as arranged, and taken to the house<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
of the Postmaster-General, Montgomery Blair. The
latter was brother-in-law to Fox, and the three breakfasted
together. "After breakfast, Fox laid before
Farragut the plan of attack, the force to be employed,
and the object to be attained, and asked his opinion.
Farragut answered unhesitatingly that it would succeed.
Fox then handed him the list of vessels being
fitted out, and asked if they were enough. Farragut
replied he would engage to run by the forts and capture
New Orleans with two thirds the number. Fox
told him more vessels would be added, and that he
would command the expedition. Farragut's delight
and enthusiasm were so great that when he left us
Fox asked if I did not think he was too enthusiastic.
I replied I was most favorably impressed with him,
and sure he would succeed."<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> There could be no
question, at any rate, that his whole heart was in the
war and in the expedition; whether he would rise
equal to his task still remained to be seen. He said,
however, frankly, that had he been previously consulted,
he would have advised against the employment
of the mortar flotilla. He had no faith in the
efficacy of that mode of attack since his observations
of the results at San Juan de Ulloa, twenty-three
years before. He was convinced that the fleet could
run by the forts, and anticipated nothing but delay
from the bombardment. Nevertheless, since the arrangements
had been made, he was willing to give
the bombs a trial. "He was never profuse in promises,"
writes Mr. Welles, the Secretary of the Navy,
"but he felt complimented that he was selected, and
I saw that in modest self-reliance he considered him<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>self
equal to the emergency and to the expectation
of the Government."<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> To his home he wrote:
"Keep your lips closed and burn my letters, for perfect
silence is to be observed&mdash;the first injunction of
the Secretary. I am to have a flag in the Gulf, and
the rest depends upon myself. Keep calm and silent.
I shall sail in three weeks."</p>

<p>On the 23d of December, 1861, Farragut received
preparatory orders, and on the 9th of the following
January was formally appointed to command the Western
Gulf Blockading Squadron; the limits of which,
on the coast of the Confederacy, were defined as from
St. Andrew's Bay to the mouth of the Rio Grande.
The coasts of Mexico and Yucatan were also embraced
in them. The steam sloop-of-war Hartford was selected
for his flag-ship. On the 20th of January final
orders were issued to him. These were somewhat discreetly
worded, and, literally understood, must be conceded
to take from the department the credit of boldly
adhering to, and assuming the responsibility of, the
original plan&mdash;a credit Mr. Welles seems desirous to
claim. "When you are completely ready," they read,
"you will collect such vessels as can be spared from
the blockade, and proceed up the Mississippi River
<i>and reduce the defenses</i> which guard the approaches to
New Orleans, <i>when</i> you will appear off that city and
take possession of it under the guns of your squadron."
Understood according to the plain meaning
of the words, these orders prescribed the reduction
of the works as a condition precedent to appearing
off the city, and so recur to the fears expressed by
both Barnard and Porter as to the consequences of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
leaving the forts unreduced. There is not in them
even "the latitude and discretion in the employment
of the means placed under his command" which Mr.
Welles claimed.<a name="FNanchor_F_6" id="FNanchor_F_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_F_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a> Had Farragut, after leaving the
forts unreduced, as he did, met with serious disaster,
it can scarcely be doubted that the phrase quoted
would have been used to acquit the Government.</p>

<p>The steam-sloop Hartford, upon which Farragut
now hoisted his flag, and in which he continued
throughout the war, was a nearly new vessel, having
sailed on her first cruise to China in the summer of
1859. She belonged to the early period of the transition
from sails to steam for the motive power of
vessels; the steam being regarded as auxiliary only,
and giving her a speed of but eight knots per
hour, while the spars and sail area were those of a
full-rigged ship. The deficiency of horse-power was
a serious drawback in such an operation as passing
forts, especially when, as in the Mississippi, the current
was strong and always adverse to vessels ascending
the river. The Hartford had, on the other
hand, a powerful battery of the best existent type.
She carried twenty-two Dahlgren nine-inch shell
guns, eleven on each side; and, owing to the lowness
of the river banks, these guns would be on a level
with or even above those in the lower tier of the
batteries opposed to her. The Pensacola, Brooklyn,
and Richmond were vessels of the same type as the
Hartford, and built at the same time.</p>

Order of Attack</span>.</span></p>



<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>


<p>On the 2d of February, 1862, the Hartford sailed
from Hampton Roads, and on the 20th reached Ship
Island. The following day Farragut took over the
command of his district and squadron from Flag
Officer McKean, who up to that time had had charge
of both the East and West Gulf. None of the other
vessels of the expedition were yet there; but they
came in one by one and were rapidly assembled at
the Southwest Pass, then the principal entrance to
the river. Much difficulty was encountered in getting
the heavier ships over the bar, two weeks' work
being needed to drag the Pensacola inside; but on
the 7th of April she floated in the river, and Farragut
found his force complete. It then consisted, independently
of the steamers attached to the mortar
flotilla, of four steam sloops-of-war of about two
thousand tons each, three of half that size, one
large side-wheel ship-of-war, the Mississippi, of seventeen
hundred tons, and nine gun-boats of five hundred.
The latter had been hurriedly built to meet
the special exigencies of this war, and were then
commonly known as the "ninety-day" gunboats.
Each carried one eleven-inch shell-gun and one
thirty-pounder rifle. The aggregate batteries of the
seventeen vessels composing the squadron, excluding
some light brass pieces, amounted to one hundred
and fifty-four cannon, of which one hundred and
thirty-five were thirty-two pounders or above.</p>

<p>The two forts which constituted the principal defenses
of New Orleans against a naval attack from
the sea were at Plaquemine Bend, about twenty miles
above the Head of the Passes; by which name is
known the point where the main stream of the Mississippi
divides into several channels, called passes,
through which its waters find their way to the Gulf.
The river, whose general course below New Orleans
is southeast, turns at Plaquemine Bend northeast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
for a mile and three-quarters, and then resumes its
previous direction. The heavier of the two works,
Fort Jackson, is on the right bank, at the lower angle
of the Bend. It was a casemated brick structure,
pentagonal in form, carrying in barbette over the
casemates twenty-seven cannon of and above the
size of thirty-two pounders, besides eleven twenty-four
pounders. In the casemates were fourteen of
the latter caliber. Attached to this fort, but below
it, was a water battery carrying half a dozen heavy
cannon. Fort St. Philip was nearly opposite Fort
Jackson, but somewhat below it, so as to command
not only the stream in its front, but also the stretch
down the river, being thus enabled to rake vessels
approaching from below before they came abreast.
It comprised the fort proper and two water batteries,
which together mounted forty-two guns. The sites
of these fortifications had been skillfully chosen; but
their armaments, though formidable and greatly superior
to those of the fleet&mdash;regard being had to the
commonly accepted maxim that a gun ashore is
equivalent to four afloat&mdash;were not equal to the demands
of the situation or to the importance of New
Orleans. Out of a total of one hundred and nine
pieces,<a name="FNanchor_G_7" id="FNanchor_G_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_G_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a> of which probably over ninety could be used
against a passing fleet, fifty-six, or more than half,
were of the very old and obsolete caliber of twenty-four
pounders.</p>

<p>This inadequate preparation, a year after the
attack upon Fort Sumter and the outbreak of hostilities,
is doubtless to be attributed to surprise.
The Southern authorities, like those of the National<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
Government, were firmly possessed with the idea
that the Mississippi, if subdued at all, must be so by
an attack from the north. Despite the frequency of
spies and treason along the border line of the two
sections, the steps of the Navy Department were
taken so quietly, and followed so closely upon the
resolve to act, that the alarm was not quickly taken;
and when intimations of attack from the sea did
filter through, they had to encounter and dislodge
strong contrary preoccupations in the minds of the
Southern leaders. Only the Confederate general
commanding the military division and his principal
subordinates seem to have been alive to the danger
of New Orleans, and their remonstrances had no
effect. Not only were additional guns denied them
and sent North, but drafts were made on their
narrow resources to supply points considered to
be in greater danger. A striking indication of the
prepossessions which controlled the authorities at
Richmond was elicited by Commodore Hollins, of
the Confederate Navy. That gallant veteran was
ordered to take to Memphis several of the rams
extemporized at New Orleans. He entreated the
Navy Department to allow him to remain, but the
reply was that the main attack upon New Orleans
would be from above, not from below. After the
fleet entered the river he telegraphed from Memphis
for permission to return, but received the answer
that the proposition was wholly inadmissible.
Before the Court of Inquiry upon the loss of New
Orleans, he testified that the withdrawal of his ships
was the chief cause of the disaster.<a name="FNanchor_H_8" id="FNanchor_H_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_H_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>

<p>While the heavy ships were being dragged over
the bar at the Southwest Pass, the mortar flotilla had
entered the river under the command of Commander
Porter. No time was avoidably lost, though there
were inevitable delays due to the magnitude of the
preparations that in every quarter taxed the energies
of the Government. On the 16th of April, less than
ten days after the Pensacola got safely inside, the
fleet was anchored just out of range of the forts.
On the 18th the mortar vessels were in position, and
at 10 <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span> the bombardment by them began, continuing
throughout the succeeding days till the passage
of the fleet, and being chiefly directed upon
Fort Jackson. From daylight to dark a shell a
minute was fired, and as the practice was remarkably
good a great proportion of these fell within the fort.
As Farragut had predicted, they did not in the
course of six days' bombardment do harm enough to
compel a surrender or disable the work; but they
undoubtedly harassed the garrison to an extent that
exercised an appreciable effect upon the fire of Jackson
during the passage.</p>

<p>While the bombardment was progressing, the
lighter vessels of the squadron were continuously
engaged by detachments in protecting the mortar
flotilla, steaming up above it and drawing upon
themselves the fire of the forts. A more important
duty was the removal of the obstructions that the
enemy had thrown across the river, below the works,
but under their fire. Opinions differed, both in the
United States squadron and in the counsels of the
enemy, as to the power of the ships to pass the forts;
but it was realized on both sides that any barrier to
their passage which should force them to stop under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
fire, or should throw confusion into their order,
would materially increase the chances against them.
Whatever the blindness or neglect of the Confederate
Government, the Confederate officers of the department
had not been remiss in this matter. The construction
of a floating barrier had early engaged
their attention, and, despite the difficulties presented
by so rapid a current, a formidable raft had been
placed early in the winter. It consisted of cypress
logs forty feet long and four or five feet in diameter,
lying lengthwise in the river, with an interval of
three feet between them to allow drift to pass. The
logs were connected by two and a half inch iron
cables, stretching underneath from one side of the
stream to the other; and the whole fabric was held
up against the current by some thirty heavy anchors
and cables. So long as it stood, this constituted a
very grave difficulty for an attacking fleet; but the
water was deep and the holding ground poor, so that
even under average conditions there was reason to
fear its giving way. The fleet arrived in the early
spring, the season when the current, swollen by the
melting snows about the head waters of the Mississippi
and its tributaries, is at its strongest; and in
1862 the spring rise was greater than for many years.
In February the raft began to show signs of yielding
under the pressure of the drift wood accumulating
on it from above, and on the 10th of March the
cables had parted, the sections on either side being
swept against the banks and leaving about a third of
the river open. The gap was filled by anchoring in
it eight heavy schooners of about two hundred tons
burden. They were joined together as the cypress
logs had been, but with lighter chains, probably be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>cause
no heavy ones were at hand; and, as a further
embarrassment to the assailants, their masts were
unstepped and allowed to drag astern with the
rigging attached, in the hopes that by fouling the
screws the ascending vessels might be crippled.</p>

<p>This central barrier of schooners was not intrinsically
strong, but it was not to be despised, considering
the very moderate speed possessed by the
ships and the strength of the current which they had
to stem. It was doubtful whether they could break
through with so little loss of way as to produce no
detention; and the mere presence of so many hulls
on a dark night and under the added gloom of the
battle's smoke was liable to increase a confusion
which could redound only to the advantage of the
defense. It became necessary, therefore, to remove
the schooners in whole or in part. This was effected
in a very daring manner by two gunboats,
the Itasca and Pinola, Captains Caldwell and
Crosby; the fleet captain, Henry H. Bell, an officer
in whom Farragut had the most unbounded confidence,
being placed in command of both. The
work had to be done, of course, within range of
the hostile batteries, which, through some culpable
negligence, failed to molest it. The Pinola carried
an electrician with a petard, by which it was hoped
to shatter the chains. This attempt, however, failed,
owing to the wires of the electrical battery parting
before the charge could be exploded. The Itasca,
on the other hand, ran alongside one of the schooners
and slipped the chains; but, unfortunately, as the
hulk was set adrift without Captain Caldwell being
notified, and the engines of the gunboat were going
ahead with the helm a-port, the two vessels turned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
inshore and ran aground under fire of the forts. In
this critical position the Itasca remained for some
time, until the Pinola could be recalled to her assistance;
and then several attempts had to be made before
she finally floated. Caldwell then did an exceedingly
gallant thing, the importance of which
alone justified, but amply justified, its temerity. Instead
of returning at once to the squadron, satisfied
with the measure of success already attained, he deliberately
headed up the river; and then, having
gained sufficient ground in that direction to insure
a full development of his vessel's speed, he turned
and charged full upon the line of hulks. As she
met the chains, the little vessel rose bodily three or
four feet from the water, sliding up on them and
dragging the hulks down with her. The chains
stood the strain for an instant, then snapped, and
the Itasca, having wrought a practicable breach,
sped down to the fleet.</p>

<p>While these various accessory operations were
going on, Admiral Farragut's mind was occupied
with the important question of carrying out the object
of his mission. The expedient of reducing or
silencing the fire of the enemy's forts, in which he
himself had never felt confidence, was in process of
being tried; and the time thus employed was being
utilized by clearing the river highway and preparing
the ships to cut their way through without delay, in
case that course should be adopted. Much had been
done while at the Head of the Passes, waiting for
the Pensacola to cross the bar; but the work was
carried on unremittingly to the last moment. The
loftier and lighter spars of all the vessels had already
been sent ashore, together with all unneces<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>sary
encumbrances, several of the gunboats having
even unstepped their lower masts; and the various
ordinary precautions, known to seamen under the
name of "clearing ship for action," had been taken
with reference to fighting on anchoring ground.
These were particularized in a general order issued
by the admiral, and to them he added special instructions,
rendered necessary by the force of the current
and its constancy in the same direction. "Mount
one or two guns on the poop and top-gallant forecastle,"
he said; "in other words, be prepared to
use as many guns as possible ahead and astern to
protect yourself against the enemy's gunboats and
batteries, bearing in mind that you will always have
to ride head to the current, and can only avail yourself
of the sheer of the helm to point a broadside
gun more than three points (thirty-four degrees)
forward of the beam.... Trim your vessel also a
few inches by the head, so that if she touches the
bottom she will not swing head down the river,"
which, if the stern caught the bottom, would infallibly
happen, entailing the difficult man&oelig;uvre and
the perilous delay of turning round under the
enemy's fire in a narrow river and in the dark. The
vessels generally had secured their spare iron cables
up and down their sides in the line of the boilers and
engines; and these vital parts were further protected
by piling around them hammocks, bags of sand or
ashes, and other obstructions to shot. The outsides
of the hulls were daubed over with Mississippi mud,
to be less easily discerned in the dark; while the
decks were whitewashed, so as to throw in stronger
relief articles lying upon them which needed to be
quickly seen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>Having given his general instructions, the flag
officer could intrust the details of preparation to
his subordinates; but no one could relieve him of
the momentous decision upon which the issues of the
campaign must turn. The responsibility of rejecting
one course of action and adopting another was his
alone; and as has already been remarked, the wording
of the department's order, literally understood,
imposed upon him the task of reducing the forts before
approaching the city. The questions involved
were essentially the same as those presented to
every general officer when the course of a campaign
has brought him face to face with a strong
position of the enemy. Shall it be carried by direct
attack, and, until so subdued, arrest the progress of
the army? or can it be rendered impotent or untenable
by severing its communications and by
operations directed against the district in its rear,
which it protects, and upon which it also depends?
The direct attack may be by assault, by investment,
or by regular siege approaches; but whatever the
method, the result is the same&mdash;the assailant is detained
for a longer or shorter time before the position.
During such detention the post fulfills its
mission of securing the region it covers, and permits
there the uninterrupted prosecution of the military
efforts of every character which are designed to impede
the progress of the invader.</p>

<p>To such cases no general rule applies; each turns
upon particular conditions, and, although close similarities
may exist between various instances, probably
no two are entirely identical. It is evident, however,
that very much will depend upon the offensive power
shut up in the position under consideration. If it be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
great walled town, such as are found on the Continent
of Europe, behind whose defenses are sheltered numerous
troops, the assailant who advances beyond it
thereby exposes his communications to attack; and,
to guard against this danger, must protect them by
a force adequate to hold the garrison in check. If,
again, there be but a single line by which the communications
can be maintained, by which supplies
and re-enforcements can go forward, and that line
passes close under the work and is commanded by
it, the garrison may be small, incapable of external
action, and yet may vitally affect the future operations
of the venturesome enemy who dares to leave
it unsubdued behind him. Such, to some extent, was
the Fort of Bard, in the narrow pass of the Dora
Baltea, to Napoleon's crossing of the St. Bernard in
1800; and such, to some extent, would be Forts
Jackson and St. Philip to Farragut's fleet after it
had fought its way above. The Mississippi was the
great line of communication for the fleet; no other
was comparable to it&mdash;except as a by-path in a
mountain is comparable to a royal highway&mdash;and
the forts commanded the Mississippi. Their own
offensive power was limited to the range of their
guns; their garrisons were not fitted, either by their
number or their aptitudes, for offensive action upon
the water; but so long as their food and ammunition
lasted, though an occasional vessel might run
by them, no steady stream of supplies, such as every
armed organization needs, could pass up the Mississippi.
Finally, though the garrison could not move,
there lay behind or under the forts a number of armed
vessels, whose precise powers were unknown, but concerning
which most exaggerated rumors were current.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The question, therefore, looming before Farragut
was precisely that which had been debated before
the President in Washington; precisely that on
which Fox had differed from Porter and Barnard.
It was, again, closely analogous to that which divided
Sherman and Grant when the latter, a year after
Farragut ran by the forts, made his famous decision
to cut adrift from his communications by the upper
Mississippi, to march past Vicksburg by the west
bank of the river, to cross below the works, and so
cut off the great stronghold of the Mississippi from
the country upon which it depended for food and re-enforcements.<a name="FNanchor_I_9" id="FNanchor_I_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_I_9" class="fnanchor">[I]</a>
But as Grant's decision rested upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
a balance of arguments applicable to the problem
before him, so did Farragut's upon a calculation of
the risks and advantages attendant, respectively,
upon the policy of waiting for the forts to fall, or of
speeding by them to destroy the resources upon
which they depended.</p>

<p>The reasons in favor of waiting for the fall of the
works were ably presented by Commander Porter in
a paper which he asked to have read in a council of
commanding officers of the fleet, assembled on board
the flag-ship on the third day of the bombardment,
April 20. Farragut was already familiar with the
arguments on both sides, and Porter's paper can be
regarded only as an expression of views already uttered,
but now invested with a formality becoming
the seriousness of the occasion. In its finality it
has somewhat the character of a protest, though indirect
and couched in perfectly becoming language,
against a decision which Farragut had now reached
and which Porter had always combated. The latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
does not appear to have doubted the ability of the
fleet to pass the works, but he questioned the utility
and expediency of so doing. His words were as
follows:<a name="FNanchor_J_10" id="FNanchor_J_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_J_10" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The objections to running by the forts are
these: It is not likely that any intelligent enemy
would fail to place chains across above the forts, and
raise such batteries as would protect them against
our ships. Did we run the forts we should leave an
enemy in our rear, and the mortar vessels would
have to be left behind. We could not return to
bring them up without going through a heavy and
destructive fire. If the forts are run, part of the
mortars should be towed along, which would render
the progress of the vessels slow against the strong
current at that point. If the forts are first captured,
the moral effect would be to close the batteries on
the river and open the way to New Orleans; whereas,
if we don't succeed in taking them, we shall have
to fight our way up the river. Once having possession
of the forts, New Orleans would be hermetically
sealed, and we could repair damages and go up on
our own terms and in our own time.... Nothing
has been said about a combined attack of army and
navy. Such a thing is not only practicable, but, if
time permitted, should be adopted. Fort St. Philip
can be taken with two thousand men covered by the
ships, the ditch can be filled with fascines, and the
wall is easily to be scaled with ladders. It can be
attacked in front and rear."</p></div>

<p>In summoning his captains to meet him on this
occasion, Farragut had no idea of calling a council-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>of-war
in the sense which has brought that name
into disrepute. He sent for them, not because he
wanted to make up his mind, but because it was
made up, and he wished at once to impart to them
his purposes and receive the benefit of any suggestion
they might make. Bell, the chief-of-staff, who
was present, has left a memorandum of what passed,
which is interesting as showing that the members
were not called to express an opinion as to the propriety
of the attack, but to receive instructions as to
the method, on which they could suggest improvements.</p>

<p>"April 20, 10 <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span> Signal was made for all captains
commanding to repair on board the flag-ship.
All being present except the three on guard to-day,
viz., Commander De Camp and Lieutenants-Commanding
Nichols and Russell, the flag-officer unfolded
his plan of operations, assigning the places for
every vessel in the fleet in the attack, and exhibited his
charts of the river and of the forts. Some discussion
was had thereupon, and Commander Alden read
a written communication to the flag-officer from
Commander Porter at his request, expressing his
views as to the operation against the forts. Having
read them, Commander Alden folded up the paper
and returned it to his pocket, whereupon I suggested
the propriety of the document being left with the
flag-officer, and the paper was accordingly left in his
hands. It was therein stated that the boom being a
protection to the mortars against attacks of all kinds
from above, the boom should not be destroyed until
the forts were reduced. Upon this the flag-officer
remarked that the commander had this morning assented
to the propriety of the boom being broken to-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>night&mdash;which
I heard&mdash;and, again, that the fleet
should not go above the forts, as the mortar fleet
would be left unprotected. The flag-officer thought
the mortars would be as well protected above as below
the forts, and that co-operation with the army,
which entered into the plans of both parties, could
not be effectual unless some of the troops were introduced
above the forts at the same time that they are
below. Once above, he intended to cover their landing
at Quarantine, five miles above, they coming to
the river through the bayou there. Once above, the
forts were cut off and his propellers intact for ascending
the river to the city. And in passing the
forts, if he found his ships able to cope with them,
he should fight it out. Some of the captains and
commanders considered it a hazardous thing to go
above, as being out of the reach of supplies. To
this it may be said that the steamers can pass down
at the rate of twelve miles an hour. The flag-officer
remarked that our ammunition is being rapidly consumed
without a supply at hand, and that something
must be done immediately. He believed in celerity.
It was proposed by myself and assented to by the
flag-officer, that three steamers should go up the
river shortly after dark, under my own guidance, to
break the boom."</p>

<p>It appears from this account, supported by the
general order issued immediately after it and given
a few pages further on, that Farragut had definitely
determined not to await the reduction of the forts,
because the bombardment so far did not indicate
any probability of effectual results. It was his deliberate
opinion that the loss of time and the waste
of effort were entailing greater risks than would be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
caused by cutting adrift from his base and severing
his own communications in order to strike at those
of the enemy. It is commonly true that in the effort
to cut the communications of an opponent one
runs the risk of exposing his own; but in this case
the attacking force was one pre-eminently qualified
to control the one great medium of communication
throughout that region&mdash;that is, the water. Also,
although in surrendering the river Farragut gave
up the great line of travel, he kept in view that the
bayou system offered an alternative, doubtless greatly
inferior, but which, nevertheless, would serve to
plant above the forts, under the protection of the
navy, such troops as should be deemed necessary;
and that the combined efforts of army and navy
could then maintain a sufficient flow of supplies
until the forts fell from isolation. Finally, a fleet
is not so much an army as a collection of floating
fortresses, garrisoned, provisioned, and mobile. It
carries its communications in its hulls, and is not in
such daily dependence upon external sources as is the
sister service.</p>

<p>In deciding, therefore, against awaiting the reduction
of the forts by direct attack, and in favor of
attempting the same result by striking at the interests
they defended and the base on which they rested,
Farragut was guided by a calculation of the comparative
<i>material</i> risks and advantages of the two
courses, and not mainly by consideration of the
moral effect produced upon the defenders by a successful
stroke, as has been surmised by Lord Wolseley.
This eminent English authority attributes the
success of the expedition against New Orleans to
three causes. "First, the inadequate previous prep<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>aration
of the naval part of the New Orleans defenses;
second, the want of harmonious working between
the Confederate naval and military forces;
and, lastly, Farragut's clear appreciation of the moral
effect he would produce by forcing his way past the
defenses of Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip, and by
his appearance before New Orleans. For, after all,
the forts were never captured by actual attack.... This
brilliant result is a striking instance of the due
appreciation by a commander of the effect which
daring achievements exert on men's minds, although,
<i>as in this case</i>, those daring acts <i>do not actually, directly,
or materially</i> make certain the end or surrender they
may have secured." And, again, in another place:
"Admiral Farragut's success was mainly due to the
moral effect produced by his gallant passage of the
forts.... He never reduced the forts, and seems to
have done them but little harm."<a name="FNanchor_K_11" id="FNanchor_K_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_K_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<p>The moral effect produced in war upon men's
minds, and through the mind upon their actions, is
undeniable, and may rightly count for much in the
calculations of a commander; but when it becomes
the sole, or even the chief reliance, as in Bonaparte's
advance into Carinthia in 1797, the spirit displayed
approaches closely to that of the gambler who
counts upon a successful bluff to disconcert his opponent.
The serious objection to relying upon
moral effect alone to overcome resistance is that
moral forces do not admit of as close knowledge
and measurement as do material conditions. The
insight and moral strength of the enemy may be
greater than you have means of knowing, and to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
assume that they are less is to fall into the dangerous
error of despising your enemy. To attribute to
so dubious a hope, alone, the daring act of Admiral
Farragut in passing the forts and encountering the
imperfectly known dangers above, is really to detract
from his fame as a capable as well as gallant
leader. That there were risks and accidents to be
met he knew full well; that he might incur disaster
he realized; that the dangers above and the power
of the enemy's vessels might exceed his expectations
was possible; war can not be stripped of hazard, and
the anxiety of the doubtful issue is the penalty
the chieftain pays for his position. But Farragut
was convinced by experience and reflection that his
fleet could force its passage; and he saw that once
above the material probabilities were that army and
navy could be combined in such a position of vantage
as would isolate the forts from all relief, and so
"actually, directly, and materially make certain their
surrender," and secure his end of controlling the
lower Mississippi. There was only one road practicable
to ships to pass above, and that led openly and
directly under the fire of the forts; but having passed
this, they were planted across the communications as
squarely as if they had made a circuit of hundreds
of miles, with all the secrecy of Bonaparte in 1800
and in 1805. Are strongholds never "captured" unless
by "actual attack"? Did Ulm and Mantua
yield to blows or to isolation?</p>

<p>Such, certainly, was the opinion of the able officers
who conducted the Confederate defense, and
whose conduct, except in matters of detail, was
approved by the searching court of inquiry that
passed upon it. "In my judgment," testified Gene<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>ral
M. L. Smith, who commanded the interior line
of works and was in no way responsible for the
fall of Forts St. Philip and Jackson, "the forts
were impregnable <i>so long as they were in free and
open communication with the city</i>. This communication
was not endangered while the obstruction existed.
The conclusion, then, is briefly this: While the
obstruction existed the city was safe; when it was
swept away, as the defenses then existed, it was in
the enemy's power."<a name="FNanchor_L_12" id="FNanchor_L_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_L_12" class="fnanchor">[L]</a> General Lovell, the commander-in-chief
of the military department, stated
that he had made preparations to evacuate New Orleans
in case the fleet passed the fort by sending out
of the city several hundred thousand rations and
securing transport steamers. He continued: "In
determining upon the evacuation of the city I necessarily,
as soon as the enemy's fleet had passed the
forts, regarded the position <i>the same as if both their
army and navy were present before the city</i>, making due
allowance simply for the time it would take them to
transport their army up. Inasmuch as their ships
had passed Forts Jackson and St. Philip, <i>they could
at once place themselves in open and uninterrupted communication
with their army at points from six to twenty
miles above the forts through various small water communications
from the Gulf</i>, made more available by the
extraordinary height of the river, and which, while
they (we?) were in possession of the latter, I had
easily and without risk defended with launches and
part of the river-defense fleet. I had also stationed
Szymanski's regiment at the Quarantine for the same
object. These were, however, all destroyed or captured<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
by the enemy's fleet after they got possession
of the river between the forts and the city."<a name="FNanchor_M_13" id="FNanchor_M_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_M_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>
Colonel Szymanski testified: "After the forts had
been passed, it was practicable for the enemy to
transport his army through the bayous and canals to
New Orleans, without encountering the forts. A
portion of the enemy did come that way. I have for
many years owned a plantation fifteen miles below
the city, and am very familiar with the whole
country. I have never known the river as high as it
was in 1862. Also, above English Turn (five miles
below the city) there is water communication through
Lake Borgne with the Gulf of Mexico by other
bayous and canals of the same character."<a name="FNanchor_N_14" id="FNanchor_N_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_N_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a></p>

<p>It is evident, therefore, that competent military
men on the spot, and in full possession of all the
facts, considered, as did Farragut, that with the
passage of the forts by the fleet the material probabilities
of success became in favor of the United
States forces. The only moral effect produced was
the mutiny of the half-disciplined alien troops that
garrisoned the forts; and surely it will not be contended
that any such wild anticipation as of that
prompted Farragut's movement. The officers of the
forts were trained and educated soldiers, who knew
their duty and would not be crushed into submission
by adverse circumstances. They would doubtless
have replied, as did the commander of Fort Morgan
two years later, that they looked upon the
United States fleet above them as their prisoners,
and they would have held out to the bitter end; but
the end was certain as soon as the fleet passed above<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
them. They had provisions for two months; then,
if not reduced by blows, they must yield to hunger.</p>

<p>Immediately after the conference with his captains,
Farragut issued the following general order,
from which it appears that, while his opinion remained
unchanged as to the expediency of running
by the forts, he contemplated the possibility, though
not the probability, of their being subdued by the
fire of the fleet, and reserved to himself freedom to
act accordingly by prescribing a simple signal, which
would be readily understood, and would convert the
attempt to pass into a sustained and deadly effort to
conquer:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p style="text-align: right">
"<span class="smcap">United States Flag-ship Hartford,<br />
Mississippi River</span>, <i>April 20, 1862</i>.
</p>

<p>"The flag-officer, having heard all the opinions
expressed by the different commanders, is of the
opinion that whatever is to be done will have to be
done quickly, or we shall be again reduced to a
blockading squadron, without the means of carrying
on the bombardment, as we have nearly expended
all the shells and fuses and material for making cartridges.
He has always entertained the same opinions
which are expressed by Commander Porter&mdash;that is,
there are three modes of attack,<a name="FNanchor_O_15" id="FNanchor_O_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_O_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> and the question
is, which is the one to be adopted? His own opinion
is that a combination of two should be made,
viz., <i>the forts should be run, and when a force is once
above the forts to protect the troops they should be landed
at Quarantine from the Gulf side by bringing them
through the bayou</i>, and then our forces should move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
up the river, mutually aiding each other as it can be
done to advantage.</p>

<p>"When in the opinion of the flag-officer the propitious
time has arrived, the signal will be made to
weigh and advance to the conflict. If, in his opinion,
at the time of arriving at the respective positions
of the different divisions of the fleet we have the advantage,
he will make the signal for close action,
No. 8, and abide the result&mdash;conquer or be conquered&mdash;drop
anchor or keep under way, as in his opinion
is best.</p>

<p>"<i>Unless the signal above mentioned is made</i>, it will
be understood that the first order of sailing will be
formed after leaving Fort St. Philip, and we will proceed
up the river <i>in accordance with the original opinion
expressed</i>.</p>

<p>"The programme of the order of sailing accompanies
this general order, and the commanders will
hold themselves in readiness for the service as indicated.</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 18em"><span class="smcap">D. G. Farragut</span>,<br /></span>
<span style="margin-left: 8em"><i>Flag-officer Western Gulf Blockading Squadron</i>".<br /><br /></span>
</p></div>

<p>Nothing can be clearer than that the opinion expressed
and maintained by the flag-officer from the
beginning was the one carried out, resulting in a
complete success.</p>

<p>The bombardment by the mortar flotilla was continued
three days longer, at the end of which time
the provision of bombs immediately obtainable was
becoming exhausted. Enough, however, remained to
sustain a very vigorous fire during the period of the
passage, and as the cover of darkness was desired
the delay was not without its advantages, for the
waning moon grew daily less and rose an hour later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
each succeeding night. On the 23d notice was given
to the ships that the attempt to pass would be made
that night, and that, as half-past three was the hour
of moon-rise, the signal, two red lights, would be
hoisted at 2 <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span> During that afternoon Farragut
personally visited each ship, in order to know positively
that each commander understood his orders
for the attack, and to see that all was in readiness.</p>

<p>The original intention of the flag-officer was to
attack in two parallel columns, a more compact formation
than one long one, less liable to straggling,
and in which the heavy batteries of the larger ships
would more effectually cover the lighter vessels by
keeping down the fire of the enemy. In this arrangement,
which remained unaltered until the 23d,
the second in command, Captain Theodorus Bailey,
whose divisional flag was flying in the gunboat
Cayuga, would have had the right column, and the
flag-officer himself the left in the Hartford. The
latter was to be followed by the Brooklyn and Richmond,
and upon these three heavy ships would fall
the brunt of the engagement with Fort Jackson, the
more powerful of the enemy's works. The right column
also had its heaviest ships in the lead; the exceptional
station of the Cayuga being due to some
natural unwillingness on the part of other commanding
officers to receive on board, as divisional commander
and their own superior, an officer whose position
in the fleet was simply that of captain of a
single ship.<a name="FNanchor_P_16" id="FNanchor_P_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_P_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a> The Cayuga led, not in virtue of her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
armament, but because she bore on board the commander
of one column.</p>

<p>On the 23d Farragut, considering the narrowness
of the opening in the obstructions through which the
fleet must pass, decided that the risk of collision
with the hulks on either side, or between the columns
themselves, would be too great if he adhered to his
written programme; and he accordingly gave a verbal
order that the right column should weigh first, and
be followed closely by the other under his own
guidance. To facilitate the departure and avoid
confusion, the ships of the right shifted their berth
after dark to the east side of the river, anchoring in
the order prescribed to them.</p>

<p>As some doubts had been expressed as to the
actual rupture of the chains between the hulks on
either side the breach, although they had evidently
been dragged from their position by the efforts made
on the night of the 20th, Lieutenant Caldwell was
again chosen, at his own request, to make an examination
of the actual conditions. This he did in the
early part of the night, before the ships got under
way; and it is a singular confirmation of the slackness
and inefficiency that has been charged against
the water service of the Confederates that he effected
this duty thoroughly and without molestation. Twice
he pulled above the hulks and thence allowed his
boat to drift down between them, a heavy lead with
sixty feet of line hanging from her bows. As this
line caught on nothing it was clear that within the
narrow limits of the breach no impediment to the
passage of a vessel existed. By 11 <span class="smcap">p.&nbsp;m.</span> Caldwell
was on his return with this decisive and encouraging
report.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>At 2 <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span> the appointed signal was made, and at
once was heard in every direction the clank-clank of
the chains as the seamen hove the anchors to the
bows. The strength of the current and the tenacity
of the bottom in some spots made this operation
longer than had been expected, and not till half-past
three did the leading vessel reach the line of hulks,
followed closely by the rest of her division. There
is something singularly impressive in the thought of
these moments of silent tension, following the active
efforts of getting under way and preceding the
furious strife, for whose first outburst every heart on
board was waiting; and the impression is increased by
the petty size of the little vessel in the lead, which
thus advanced with steady beating of the engines to
bear the first blast of the storm. Favored partly by
her size, and yet more by the negligence of those
among the enemy whose duty it was to have kept
the scene alight with the numerous fire-rafts provided
for that very purpose, the Cayuga passed the
hulks and was well on her way up river before she
was seen. "Although it was a starlight night,"
wrote Lieutenant Perkins, who by her commander's
direction was piloting the ship, "we were not discovered
until well under the forts; then they opened
upon us a tremendous fire." It was the prelude to a
drama of singular energy and grandeur, for the Confederates
in the forts were fully on their guard, and
had anticipated with unshaken courage, but with
gloomy forebodings, an attack during that very
night. "There will be no to-morrow for New Orleans,"
had said the undaunted commander of Fort
Jackson the day before, "if the navy does not at
once move the Louisiana to the position assigned to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
her," close to the obstructions. The Louisiana was
a powerful ironclad battery, not quite complete
when Farragut entered the river. She had been
hurried down to the forts four days before the passage
of the fleet, but her engines could not drive her,
and the naval commander refused to take up the
position, asked of him by the military authorities,
below St. Philip, where he would have a cross fire
with the forts, a close command of the line of obstructions,
and would greatly prolong the gantlet
of fire through which the fleet must run. To support
the movement of the latter by drawing the fire
and harassing the gunners of the enemy, Commander
Porter moved up with the steamers of the
mortar flotilla to easy range of the water battery
under Fort Jackson, which he engaged; while the
mortar schooners, as soon as the flash of the
enemy's guns showed that the head of the column
had been discovered, opened a furious bombardment,
keeping two shells constantly in the air. Except for
the annoyance of the bombs, the gunners of the forts
had it much their own way until the broadsides of
the Pensacola, which showed eleven heavy guns on
either side, drew up abreast of them. "The Cayuga
received the first fire," writes Perkins, "and the air
was filled with shells and explosives which almost
blinded me as I stood on the forecastle trying to see
my way, for I had never been up the river before.
I soon saw that the guns of the forts were all aimed
for midstream, so I steered close under the walls of
Fort St. Philip; and although our masts and rigging
got badly shot through our hull was but little damaged."
Small as she was&mdash;five hundred tons&mdash;and
with the scanty top hamper of a schooner, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Cayuga was struck forty-two times, below and
aloft.</p>

<p>"After passing the last battery," continues Perkins,
"and thinking we were clear, I looked back
for some of our vessels, and my heart jumped up
into my mouth when I found I could not see a single
one. I thought they all must have been sunk by the
forts." This seeming desertion was due to the fact
that the heavy ships&mdash;the Pensacola, Mississippi, and
Oneida&mdash;had been detained by the resolute manner in
which the first stopped to engage Fort St. Philip.
Stopping to fire, then moving slowly, then stopping
again, the reiterated broadsides of this big ship, delivered
at such close range that the combatants on
either side exchanged oaths and jeers of defiance,
beat down the fire of the exposed barbette batteries,
and gave an admirable opportunity for slipping by
to the light vessels, which brought up the rear of
the column and were wholly unfit to contend with
the forts. The Mississippi and Oneida keeping close
behind the Pensacola and refusing to pass her, the
Cayuga was thus separated from all her followers.</p>

<p>The isolation of the Cayuga was therefore caused
by her anomalous position at the head of the column,
a post proper only to a heavy ship. It was
impossible for her petty battery of two guns to pause
before the numerous pieces of the enemy; it was
equally impossible for the powerful vessels following
her to hasten on, leaving to the mercy of the Confederates
the gunboats of the same type that succeeded
them in the order. That the Cayuga was
thus exposed arose from the amiable desire of the
admiral to gratify Bailey's laudable wish to share in
the battle, without compelling an officer of the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
grade, and junior only in number, to accept a superior
on his own quarter-deck in the day of battle,
when the harvest of distinction is expected to repay
the patient sowing of preparation. The commander
of the Cayuga, who was only a lieutenant, had reconciled
these conflicting claims by volunteering to
carry Bailey's divisional flag. As there is no reason
to suppose that Farragut deliberately intended to
offer the gunboat up as a forlorn hope by drawing
the first fire of the enemy, always the most
deadly, and thus saving the more important vessels,
the disposition of her constitutes the only serious
fault in his tactical arrangements on this occasion&mdash;a
fault attributable not to his judgment, but to one
of those concessions to human feelings which circumstances
at times extort from all men. His first
intention, an advance in two columns, the heavy
ships leading and closely engaging the forts with
grape and canister, while the two-gun vessels
slipped through between the columns, met the tactical
demands of the proposed operation. The decision
to abandon this order in favor of one long,
thin line, because of the narrowness of the opening,
can not be challenged. This formation was distinctly
weaker and more liable to straggling, but nothing
could be so bad as backing, collision, or stoppage
at the obstructions. In such an attack, however, as
in all of Farragut's battles, it seems eminently fitting
that the commander of the column should lead.
The occasion is one for pilotage and example; and
inasmuch as the divisional commander can not control,
except by example, any ship besides the one
on board which he himself is, that ship should be
the most powerful in his command. These conclusions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
may hereafter be modified by conditions of
submarine warfare, though even under them it seems
likely that in forcing passage into a harbor the van
ship should carry the flag of the officer commanding
the leading division; but under the circumstances
of Farragut's day they may be accepted as representing
his own convictions, first formed by the
careful deliberation of a man with a genius for
war, and afterward continually confirmed by his
ever-ripening experience.</p>

<p>Left thus unsupported by the logical results of
her false position, the Cayuga found herself exposed
to an even greater danger than she had already run
from the guns of the stationary works. "Looking
ahead," says Perkins's letter, already quoted, "I saw
eleven of the enemy's gunboats coming down upon
us, and it seemed as if we were 'gone' sure." The
vessels thus dimly seen in the darkness of the night
were a heterogeneous, disorganized body, concerning
which, however, very imperfect and very exaggerated
particulars had reached the United States fleet.
They were freely spoken of as ironclad gunboats
and ironclad rams, and the Confederates had done
all in their power to increase the moral effect which
was attendant upon these names, then new to maritime
warfare. None of them had been built with
any view to war. Three only were sea-going, with
the light scantling appropriate to their calling as
vessels for freight and passenger traffic. Another
had been a large twin-screw tugboat that began her
career in Boston, and thence, shortly before the war,
had been sent to the Mississippi. After the outbreak
of hostilities she had been covered with an
arched roof and three-quarter-inch iron; a nine-inch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
gun, capable only of firing directly ahead, had been
mounted in her bows, and, thus equipped, she passed
into notoriety as the ram Manassas. With the miserable
speed of six knots, to which, however, the
current of the river gave a very important addition,
and with a protection scarcely stronger than the
buckram armor of the stage, the Manassas, by her
uncanny appearance and by the persistent trumpeting
of the enemy, had obtained a very formidable
reputation with the United States officers, who could
get no reliable information about her.</p>

<p>The remainder of the force were river steamboats,
whose machinery was protected with cotton,
and their stems shod with one-inch iron, clamped in
place by straps of the same material extending a few
feet aft. Thus strengthened, it was hoped that with
the sharpness of their bows and the swiftness of the
current they could, notwithstanding the exceeding
lightness of their structure, penetrate the hulls of
the United States ships. Resolutely and vigorously
handled, there can be little doubt that they might
have sunk one or two of their assailants; but there is
no probability that they could under all the circumstances
have done more. The obscurity of the night,
the swiftness of the stream, and the number of actors
in the confusing drama being played between the
two banks of the Mississippi, would have introduced
into the always delicate fencing of the ram extraordinary
difficulties, with which the inexperience of
their commanders was in no degree qualified to deal.
The generally steady approach, bows on, of the
United States ships, presented the smallest target to
their thrust and gave to the threatened vessel the
utmost facilities for avoiding the collision or con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>verting
it into a glancing blow; while, as for rounding-to,
to ram squarely on the beam of a ship stemming
the current, the assailant, even if he displayed
the remarkable nicety of judgment required, was not
likely to find the necessary room.</p>

<p>These difficulties received illustration by the career
of the Manassas that night. Her commander,
Lieutenant Warley, was a former officer of the United
States Navy, and he handled her with judgment and
the utmost daring. Rushing nearly bows on upon the
Pensacola, the thrust was wholly avoided by the quick
moving of the latter's helm, which Warley characterized
as beautiful; while the attempt made immediately
afterward upon the Mississippi resulted in a merely
glancing blow, which took a deep and long shaving
out of the enemy's quarter, but did no serious damage.
Not till a much later period of the action did the
Manassas find an opportunity to charge squarely upon
the beam of the Brooklyn. She did so across the current,
striking therefore only with her own speed of six
knots. But little shock was felt on board the rammed
ship, and no apprehension of damage was experienced;
but it was afterward found that the enemy's
stem had entered between two frames, and crushed
both the outer and inner planking. A few moments
earlier the Brooklyn had been thrown across the current
by the chances of the night. Had the ram then
struck her in the same place, carrying the four knots
additional velocity of the current, it is entirely possible
that the mortification of the Confederate defeat
would have derived some consolation from the sinking
of one of Farragut's best ships. Such were the
results obtained by a man of singular and resolute
character, who drove his tiny vessel through the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
powerful broadsides of the hostile fleet, and dared
afterward to follow its triumphant course up the
river, in hopes of snatching another chance from the
jaws of defeat.</p>

<p>Another example, equally daring and more successful,
of the power of the ram, was given that
same night by Kennon, also an ex-officer of the
United States Navy; but the other ram commanders
did not draw from their antecedent training and
habits of thought the constancy and pride, which
could carry their frail vessels into the midst of ships
that had thus victoriously broken their way through
the bulwarks of the Mississippi. The River-Defense
Fleet, as it was called, was a separate organization,
which owned no allegiance and would receive no
orders from the navy; and its absurd privileges were
jealously guarded by a government whose essential
principle was the independence of local rights from
all central authority. Captains of Mississippi River
steamboats, their commanders held to the full the
common American opinion that the profession of
arms differs from all others in the fact that it requires
no previous training, involves no special habits of
thought, is characterized by no moral tone which
only early education or years of custom can impart.
Rejecting all suggestion and neglecting all preparation,
they cherished the most inordinate confidence
in the raw native valor which they were persuaded
would inspire them at the critical moment; and, incredible
as it would seem, some of the men who in
the battle could find no other use for their boats but
to run them ashore and burn them, ventured to tell
Warley the night before that their mission was to
show naval officers how to fight. They did not lack<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
courage, but that military habit upon whose influence
Farragut had so acutely remarked when a youth, returning
in 1820 from the European station.<a name="FNanchor_Q_17" id="FNanchor_Q_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_Q_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> "Had
regular naval officers," said Kennon bitterly, "instead
of being kept in the mud forts on the creeks in
Virginia, and in the woods of Carolina cutting timbers
to build ironclads, been sent to command these
vessels, even at the eleventh hour, they would have
proved very formidable."</p>

<p>Steaming into the midst of such as these, the
peril of the Cayuga, real enough, was less than it
seemed; but she had to do at once with Warley's
Manassas and with the Governor Moore, the vessel
that Kennon commanded, and which afterward
sunk the Varuna. "Three made a dash to board
us," records Lieutenant Perkins, agreeing therein
with the official reports of Captain Bailey and of
his own commander, Lieutenant Harrison; "but a
heavy charge from our eleven-inch gun settled
the Governor Moore, which was one of them. A
ram, the Manassas, in attempting to butt us just
missed our stern, and we soon settled the third fellow's
'hash.' Just then some of our gunboats which
had passed the forts came up, and then all sorts of
things happened." This last expression is probably
as terse and graphic a summary of a <i>mêlée</i>, which to
so many is the ideal of a naval conflict, as ever was
penned. "There was the wildest excitement all
round. The Varuna fired a broadside into us instead
of into the enemy. Another of our gunboats attacked
one of the Cayuga's prizes; I shouted out,
'Don't fire into that ship, she has surrendered.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Three of the enemy's ships had surrendered to us
before any of our vessels appeared; but when they
did come up we all pitched in, and settled the eleven
rebel vessels in about twenty minutes." Besides the
eleven armed boats known to have been above, there
were several unarmed tugs and other steamers, some
of which probably shared in this wild confusion.
One at least came into conflict with the Hartford.</p>

<p>The second column, led by the flag-ship, was
promptly away and after the first; following, indeed,
so closely that the head of the one lapped the rear
of the other. The Brooklyn and Richmond, close
behind the Hartford, formed with her a powerful
"body of battle," to use the strong French expression
for the center of a fleet. Though called sloops-of-war,
the tonnage and batteries of these ships were
superior to those of the medium ships-of-the-line of
the beginning of this century, with which Nelson
fought his celebrated battles. As the flag-ship
reached the hulks the night, which, though very
dark, was fairly clear, had become obscured by the
dense clouds of smoke that an almost breathless atmosphere
suffered to settle down upon the water.
Only twenty minutes had elapsed since the forts
opened upon the Cayuga, when Farragut's flag entered
the battle. Soon after passing the obstructions,
and when about to sheer in toward Fort Jackson,
upon which was to be concentrated her own battery
and that of her two formidable followers, a fire-raft
was observed coming down the river in such a way
as to make contact probable if the course were not
changed. Heading across the river, and edged gradually
over by the raft continuing to work toward
her, the ship took the ground a little above Fort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
St. Philip, but still under its batteries. While in
this dangerous position, the raft, whose movements
proved to be controlled not by the current but by a
small tugboat, was pushed against her port quarter.
The flames caught the side of the ship, spread swiftly
along it, leaped into the rigging and blazed up toward
the tops. The danger was imminent, and appeared
even more so than it was; for the body of
heat, though great, was scarcely sufficient to account
for such a rapid spread of the flames, which was
probably due mainly to the paint. The thoroughly
organized fire department soon succeeded in quenching
the conflagration, its source being removed by
training some of the after-guns upon the daring
pygmy, which with such reckless courage had well-nigh
destroyed the commander-in-chief of her enemy's
fleet. The tug received a shot in her boilers and
sunk. The Hartford backed clear, but in so doing
fell off broadside to the stream, thereby affording another
chance to the hostile rams, had there been one
prepared to dare the hazard. Watson, the flag-lieutenant,
remarks that the flag-officer stood during this
critical period giving his orders and watching the
ship slowly turn, referring occasionally to a little
compass which was attached to his watch-chain.
During most of the engagement, however, he was
forward observing the conflict.</p>

<p>The Brooklyn and Richmond, with the Sciota and
the Iroquois, which followed immediately after them,
fought their way through with more or less of adventure,
but successfully reached the river above the
forts. It is to be observed, however, that these, as
well as the Hartford, suffered from the embarrassment
of the smoke, which had inconvenienced the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
ships of the first column to a much less degree.
This was to be expected, and doubtless contributed
to the greater loss which they suffered, by delaying
their progress and giving uncertainty to their aim;
the result of the latter being naturally to intensify
the action of the hostile gunners. Four gunboats
brought up the rear of the column, of which but one
got through, and she with a loss greater than any
vessel of her class. The three last failed to pass.
Blinded by smoke and further delayed by the tendency
to open out, which is observable in all long columns,
they came under the fire of the forts at a time
when, the larger vessels having passed, they were no
longer covered or supported by their fire, and when
day was about to break. The Itasca, commanded
by the gallant Caldwell, who had so nobly broken
through the obstructions, opposing only her puny
battery to the concentrated wrath of the forts, was
knocked about by them at will, received a shot
through her boiler and drifted down the river out of
action. The Winona likewise encountered almost
alone, or perhaps in company with the Itasca, the
fire of the enemy. After nearly running ashore in
the smoke, daylight surprised her while still under
fire below the works; and her commander very properly
decided not to risk the total destruction and
possible capture of his vessel for the sake of adding
her insignificant force to that above. Admirably as
the gunboats were officered, perhaps their most useful
service on this night was to demonstrate again
the advantage of big ships, as of big battalions.</p>

<p>Thirteen out of his seventeen vessels having rallied
around his flag above the forts, and the three
below being of the least efficient type, the flag-officer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
could congratulate himself upon a complete victory,
won with but little loss. One vessel only was sacrificed,
and she to that inconsiderate ardor which in so
many cases of pursuit leads men, without any necessity,
out of reach of support. The Varuna, the fifth
in the order, and the only merchant-built vessel in
the fleet, after clearing the forts had steamed rapidly
through the Confederate flotilla, firing right and left,
but not stopping. She soon passed above it, and
getting sight of a small steamer heading for New
Orleans, sped away after her. Kennon, in the Governor
Moore, happened to have noticed this movement;
and, finding by the rapid accessions to the
number of his enemies that he was likely to be soon
overwhelmed, he determined to follow this one which,
whatever her strength, he might tackle alone. Stealing
out of the <i>mêlée</i> he started up the river, hoisting
lights similar to those he had observed the enemy's
ships to carry. Deceived by this ruse, the Varuna
at the first paid no attention to her pursuer, some
distance behind whom followed one of the River-Defense
boats, the Stonewall Jackson. When Kennon
at last opened fire, the Varuna, having by then
run down her steam in her headlong speed, was being
rapidly overtaken. The second shot from the Moore
raked the Varuna's deck, killing and wounding
twelve men. The Union vessel's helm was then put
hard-a-port, swinging her broadside to bear upon
her approaching foe, who was naturally expected to
imitate the movement, opposing side to side to avoid
being raked. Instead of so doing Kennon kept
straight on, and, while receiving a deadly raking fire
from his antagonist's battery, which struck down
many of his men, he succeeded in driving the sharp<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
stem of the Moore through the side of the Varuna.
A few moments after the Stonewall Jackson coming
up also rammed the disabled enemy, whose commander
then drove her ashore on the east side of
the river, where she sank. By this time the corvette
Oneida had made out the state of the case. Steaming
rapidly ahead, she overhauled the Confederate
vessels; which, finding they could not escape, ran
ashore, the Jackson on the west bank, the Moore on
the east, and in those positions they were surrendered.</p>

<p>Farragut had undertaken this daring exploit with
the expectation that, after passing the forts, he could
obtain the co-operation of the army, and that the
action of the two services, combined in mutual support,
would suffice to force the way to New Orleans.
The occupation of the land by the army, and of the
water by the navy, interposing by the nature of their
operations between the city and the forts, would effectually
isolate the latter. In accordance with this
plan he at once sent Captain Boggs, of the Varuna,
through the Quarantine Bayou with messages to
Commander Porter and General Butler. The latter
was notified that the way was now clear to land his
troops through the bayou, in accordance with the
previous arrangements, and that gunboats would be
left there to protect them against those of the
enemy, of which three or four were seen to be still
at the forts. Boggs passed successfully through the
country and streams which a day before had been in
quiet possession of the enemy, though it took him
twenty-six hours to do so; but General Butler,
who from a transport below had witnessed the success
of the fleet, had waited for no further tidings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Hurrying back to his troops, he collected them at
Sable Island, twelve miles in rear of Fort St. Philip,
whence they were transported and landed at a point
on the river five miles above the work, where the
Kineo and Wissahickon awaited them.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the 24th the fleet stayed
at anchor off the Quarantine station, to repose the
crews after the excessive labor and excitement of
the previous night. Early the next morning all got
under way except the two gunboats left to support
Butler's troops, and moved up stream; but slowly,
owing to the indifferent speed of some and to want
of knowledge of the river. At half-past ten they
reached English Turn, five miles below the city; the
point where the British forces had in 1815 been so
disastrously repelled in their assault upon the earth-works
held by Jackson's riflemen. The Confederates
had fortified and armed the same lines on both sides
of the Mississippi, as part of the interior system of
defenses to New Orleans; the exterior line being constituted
by Forts Jackson and St. Philip, together
with several smaller works at different points, commanding
the numerous subsidiary approaches through
the Mississippi delta. The interior lines at English
Turn, known as the Chalmette and McGehee batteries,
were, however, intended only to check an approach
of troops from down the river. Their general
direction was perpendicular to the stream; and
along its banks there ran only a short work on either
side to protect the main entrenchments from an enfilading
fire by light vessels, which might, in company
with an invading army, have managed to turn
the lower forts by passing through the bayous.
These river batteries, mounting respectively nine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and five guns, were powerless to resist the ships that
had successfully passed the main defenses of the
city. After a few shots, fired rather for the honor of
the flag than in any hope of successful result, the
guns were forsaken; and both lines of entrenchments,
being turned and taken in the rear, were abandoned.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in New Orleans a scene of fearful
confusion was growing hourly more frenzied. Whatever
the fears of the military commanders as to the
result of the attack upon the forts, they had very
properly concealed them from the inhabitants; and
these, swayed by the boastful temper common to
mobs, had been readily led to despise the efforts of
the enemy and to trust implicitly in the power of
their defenses. General Lovell, commanding the department,
had gone down to the forts the evening
before the attack, and was still there when the United
States fleet was breaking its way through; he was,
in fact, on board the little steamer, the pursuit of
which lured the Varuna into the isolation where she
met her fate. The news of the successful forcing of
the exterior and principal defenses thus reached the
city soon after it was effected; and at the same time
Lovell, satisfied from the first that if the forts were
passed the town was lost, prepared at once to evacuate
it, removing all the Government property. This
in itself was a service of great difficulty. New Orleans
is almost surrounded by water or marsh; the
only exit was to the northward by a narrow strip of
dry land, not over three quarters of a mile wide,
along the river bank, by which passed the railroad to
Jackson, in the State of Mississippi. As has already
been said, Lovell had by this road been quietly removing
army rations for some time, but had ab<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>stained
from trying to carry off any noticeable articles
by which his apprehensions would be betrayed
to the populace. The latter, roused from its slumber
of security with such appalling suddenness, gave
way to an outburst of panic and fury; which was the
less controllable because so very large a proportion
of the better and stronger element among the men
had gone forth to swell the ranks of the Confederate
army. As in a revolution in a South American city,
the street doors were closed by the tradesmen upon
the property in their stores; but without began a
scene of mad destruction, which has since been forcibly
portrayed by one, then but a lad of fourteen
years, who witnessed the sight.</p>

<p>Far down the stream, and throughout their ascent,
the ships were passing through the wreckage thus
made. Cotton bales, cotton-laden ships and steamers
on fire, and working implements of every kind such
as are used in ship-yards, were continually encountered.
On the piers of the levees, where were huge
piles of hogsheads of sugar and molasses, a mob, composed
of the scum of the city, men and women, broke
and smashed without restraint. Toward noon of the
25th, as the fleet drew round the bend where the Crescent
City first appears in sight, the confusion and destruction
were at their height. "The levee of New
Orleans," says Farragut in his report, "was one scene
of desolation. Ships, steamers, cotton, coal, etc.,
were all in one common blaze, and our ingenuity was
much taxed to avoid the floating conflagration. The
destruction of property was awful." Upon this pandemonium,
in which the fierce glare of burning property
lit up the wild passions and gestures of an infuriated
people, the windows of heaven were opened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
and a drenching rain poured down in torrents. The
impression produced by the ships as they came in
sight around the bend has been graphically described
by the boy before mentioned, who has since become
so well-known as an author&mdash;Mr. George W. Cable.
"I see the ships now, as they come slowly round
Slaughter House Point into full view, silent, grim,
and terrible; black with men, heavy with deadly
portent, the long-banished Stars and Stripes flying
against the frowning sky. Oh! for the Mississippi!
for the Mississippi!" (an iron-clad vessel nearly
completed, upon which great hopes had been based
by the Confederates). "Just then she came down.
But how? Drifting helplessly, a mass of flames.</p>

<p>"The crowds on the levee howled and screamed
with rage. The swarming decks answered never a
word; but one old tar on the Hartford, standing
lanyard in hand beside a great pivot gun, so plain to
view that you could see him smile, silently patted its
big black breech and blandly grinned. And now
the rain came down in torrents."</p>

<p>That same morning, as though with the purpose
of embarrassing the victor whom he could not oppose,
the Mayor of New Orleans had ordered the
State flag of Louisiana to be hoisted upon the City
Hall. His secretary, who was charged with this
office, waited to fulfill it until the cannonade at
English Turn had ceased, and it was evident the
fleet had passed the last flimsy barrier and would
within an hour appear before the city. The flag was
then run up; and the Mayor had the satisfaction of
creating a position of very unnecessary embarrassment
for all parties by his useless bravado.</p>

<p>To Captain Bailey, the second in command, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
had so gallantly led both in the first assault and in
the attack at Chalmette, was assigned the honor of
being the first to land in the conquered city and to
demand its surrender. It was no barren honor, but
a service of very sensible personal danger to which
he was thus called. General Lovell having to devote
his attention solely to his military duties, the city
which had so long been under martial law was escaping
out of the hands of the civil authorities and
fast lapsing into anarchy. Between one and two in
the afternoon Bailey landed, accompanied by Perkins,
the first lieutenant of the Cayuga; who, having
shared his former perils, was permitted to accompany
him in this one also. "We took just a boat and a
boat's crew," writes Perkins, "with a flag of truce,
and started off. When we reached the wharf there
were no officials to be seen; no one received us, although
the whole city was watching our movements,
and the levee was crowded in spite of a heavy rainstorm.
Among the crowd were many women and
children, and the women were shaking rebel flags
and being rude and noisy. They were all shouting
and hooting as we stepped on shore.... As we advanced
the mob followed us in a very excited state.
They gave three cheers for Jeff Davis and Beauregard
and three groans for Lincoln. Then they
began to throw things at us, and shout 'Hang them!'
'Hang them!' We both thought we were in a bad
fix, but there was nothing for us to do but just to go
on." Mr. Cable has given his description of the
same scene: "About one or two in the afternoon, I
being in the store with but one door ajar, came a
roar of shoutings and imprecations and crowding
feet down Common Street. 'Hurrah for Jeff Davis!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
'Shoot them!' 'Kill them!' 'Hang them!' I locked
the door of the store on the outside and ran to the
front of the mob, bawling with the rest, 'Hurrah for
Jeff Davis!' About every third man had a weapon
out. Two officers of the United States navy were
walking abreast, unguarded and alone, not looking
to the right or left, never frowning, never flinching,
while the mob screamed in their ears, shook cocked
pistols in their faces, cursed, crowded, and gnashed
upon them. So through those gates of death those
two men walked to the City Hall to demand the
town's surrender. It was one of the bravest deeds I
ever saw done."</p>

<p>Farragut's demand, made through Bailey, was
that the flag of Louisiana should be hauled down
from the City Hall, and that of the United States
hoisted over the buildings which were its property,
namely, the Custom House, Post Office, and Mint.
This the Mayor refused to do; and, as Farragut had
no force with which to occupy the city, it became a
somewhat difficult question to carry on an argument
with the authorities of a town protected by the presence
of so many women and children. The situation
was for three days exceedingly critical, from the
temper and character of the mob and from the obstinacy
and powerlessness of the officials. It was
doubtless as much as the life of any citizen of the
place was worth to comply with the admiral's demands.
On the other hand, while there could be no
difficulty in hoisting the United States flag, there
would be much in protecting it from insult with the
means at the flag-officer's disposal; for to open fire
upon a place where there were so many helpless
creatures, innocent of any greater offense than be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>having
like a set of spoiled children, was a course
that could not be contemplated unless in the last
necessity, and it was undesirable to provoke acts
which might lead to any such step. The United
States officers who were necessarily sent to communicate
with the authorities did so, in the opinion of
the authorities themselves, at the peril of their lives
from a mob which no one on shore could control.
On the 28th of April, however, Forts Jackson and
St. Philip surrendered to Commander Porter in consequence
of a mutiny in their garrisons, which refused
to fight any longer, saying further resistance
was useless; and the following day Farragut sent
ashore a body of two hundred and fifty marines with
two howitzers manned by seamen from the Hartford,
the whole under the command of the fleet-captain,
Captain Henry H. Bell. The force was formally
drawn up before the City Hall, the howitzers pointing
up and down the street, which was thronged with
people. Fearing still that some rash person in the
crowd might dare to fire upon the men who were
hauling down the flag, the Mayor took his stand before
one of the howitzers; a sufficient intimation to
the mob that were murder done he would be the
first victim to fall in expiation. The United States
flag was then hoisted over the Custom House, and
left flying under the protection of a guard of marines.</p>

<p>Thus was timely and satisfactorily completed an
act, by which Farragut signalized and sealed the fact
that the conquest of New Orleans and of its defenses,
from the original conception of the enterprise
to its complete fulfillment by the customary tokens of
submission and taking possession, was wholly the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
work of the United States Navy; of which he, by his
magnificent successes, became the representative
figure. It was a triumph won over formidable difficulties
by a mobile force, skillfully directed and gallantly
fought. By superior promptitude and a correct
appreciation of the true strategic objective had
been reduced to powerlessness obstacles not to be
overcome by direct assault, except by a loss of time
which would have allowed the enemy to complete
preparations possibly fatal to the whole undertaking.
Forts Jackson and St. Philip, which the fleet could
not have reduced by direct attack, fell by the severance
of their communications.</p>

<p>It is not to be questioned that the moral effect
of the passage of the forts, succeeded, as it was,
by the immediate fall of the great city of the Mississippi,
was very great; but it was not upon the
forts themselves, nor in the unexpected mutiny of
the garrison, that that effect was chiefly manifested.
Great as was the crime of the men, they showed by
their act a correct appreciation of those results to
the forts, from the passage of the fleet, which some
have sought to ignore&mdash;results physical, undeniable,
fatal. It was not moral effect, but indisputable reasoning
which sapped the further resistance of men&mdash;brave
till then&mdash;to whom were wanting the habit
of discipline and the appreciation of the far-reaching
effects upon the fortunes of a campaign produced
by a prolonged, though hopeless, resistance.
They saw that the fate of the forts was sealed,
and beyond that they recognized no duties and no
advantages. On the scene of his exploit Farragut
reaped the material fruits of the celerity in which
he believed; and which he had reluctantly for a space<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
postponed, at the bidding of superior authority, in
order to try the effect of slower methods. These
being exhausted, he owed to the promptness of his
decision and action that the Louisiana, on whose repairs
men were working night and day, did not take
the advantageous position indicated to her by the
officers of the forts; and that the Mississippi, the
ironclad upon which not only the designers, but
naval officers, founded extravagant hopes, was neither
completed nor towed away, but burned where she lay.
The flaming mass, as it drifted hopelessly by the
Hartford, was a striking symbol of resistance
crushed&mdash;of ascendency established over the mighty
river whose name it bore; but it was a symbol not
of moral, but of physical victory.</p>

<p>It was elsewhere, far and wide, that were felt the
moral effects which echoed the sudden, unexpected
crash with which the lower Mississippi fell&mdash;through
the length and breadth of the South and in the cabinets
of foreign statesmen, who had believed too readily,
as did their officers on the spot, that the barrier
was not to be passed&mdash;that the Queen City of the
Confederacy was impregnable to attack from the sea.
Whatever may have been the actual purposes of that
mysterious and undecided personage, Napoleon III,
the effect of military events, whether on sea or
shore, upon the question of interference by foreign
powers is sufficiently evident from the private correspondence
which, a few months after New Orleans,
passed between Lords Palmerston and Russell, then
the leading members of the British Cabinet.<a name="FNanchor_R_18" id="FNanchor_R_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_R_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a> Fortunately
for the cause of the United States, France<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
and Great Britain were not of a mind to combine
their action at the propitious moment; and the moral
effect of the victory at New Orleans was like a cold
plunge bath to the French emperor, at the time when
he was hesitating whether to act alone. It produced
upon him even more impression than upon the British
Government; because his ambitions for French
control and for the extension of the Latin races on
the American continent were especially directed toward
Louisiana, the former colony of France, and
toward its neighbors, Texas and Mexico.</p>

<p>The sympathies, however, of the classes from
whom were chiefly drawn the cabinets of the two
great naval States were overwhelmingly with the
South; and the expressions alike of the emperor and
of his principal confidants at this time were designedly
allowed to transpire, both to the Southern commissioners
and to the British Government. On the
very day that Porter's mortar schooners opened on
Fort Jackson, Louis Napoleon unbosomed himself to
a member of the British Parliament, who visited him
as an avowed partisan of the Confederate cause. He
said that while he desired to preserve a strict neutrality,
he could not consent that his people should
continue to suffer from the acts of the Federal Government.
He thought the best course would be to
make a friendly appeal to it, either alone or concurrently
with England, to open the ports; but to accompany
the appeal with a proper demonstration of force
upon our coasts, and, should the appeal seem likely
to be ineffectual, to back it by a declaration of his
purpose not to respect the blockade. The taking of
New Orleans, which he did not then anticipate,
might render it inexpedient to act; that he would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
not decide at once, but would wait some days for
further intelligence.<a name="FNanchor_S_19" id="FNanchor_S_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_S_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a> Similar semi-official assurances
came from different persons about the emperor; and
the members of the Cabinet, with a single exception,
showed little reserve in their favorable expressions
toward the Confederacy.</p>

<p>A few weeks later Mr. Slidell had a conversation
with M. Billault, the minister <i>sans portefeuille</i>, one of
the most conservative and cautious men in the Cabinet,
who represented the Government in the Chambers
upon all subjects connected with foreign affairs. Slidell
read a note which he had received from Sir Charles
Wood, a leading Southern sympathizer in England, denying
that the British Government was unwilling to
act in American affairs&mdash;a denial to which some color
is given by the correspondence of Palmerston and
Russell before mentioned. In answer, M. Billault declared
that the French Cabinet, with the possible exception
of M. Thouvénel, had been unanimously in
favor of the South, and added that if New Orleans had
not fallen its recognition would not have been much
longer delayed; but, even after that disaster, if decided
successes were obtained in Virginia and Tennessee,
or the enemy were held at bay for a month
or two, the same result would follow. After an interview
with M. Thouvénel, about the same time,
Slidell reported that, though that minister did not directly
say so, his manner gave fair reason to infer that
if New Orleans had not been taken, and no very serious
reverses were suffered in Virginia and Tennessee, recognition
would very soon have been declared.<a name="FNanchor_T_20" id="FNanchor_T_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_T_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a></p>

<p>In its moral effect, therefore, the fall of the river
forts and of New Orleans, though not absolutely and
finally decisive of the question of foreign intervention,
corresponded to one of those telling blows, by
which a general threatened by two foes meets and
strikes down one before the other comes up. Such
a blow may be said to decide a campaign; not because
no chance is left the enemy to redeem his misfortune,
but because without the first success the
weaker party would have been overwhelmed by the
junction of his two opponents. The heart-rending
disasters to our armies during the following summer
does but emphasize the immense value to the Union
cause of the moral effect produced by Farragut's
victory. Those disasters, as it was, prompted the
leaders of the British ministry to exchange confidences
in which they agreed on the expediency of
mediation. They did not carry all their colleagues
with them; but who can estimate the effect, when
the scales were thus balancing, if the navy had been
driven out of the Mississippi as the army was from
Virginia?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>THE FIRST ADVANCE ON VICKSBURG.<br /><br />

1862.</h3>


<p>The purpose of the Navy Department, as expressed
in the original orders to Farragut, had been
to send his squadron up the river immediately after
the capture of New Orleans. The words were: "If
the Mississippi expedition from Cairo shall not have
descended the river, you will take advantage of the
panic to push a strong force up the river to take all
their defenses in the rear." When New Orleans fell,
the Cairo expedition, more commonly known as the
Mississippi flotilla, so far from having descended the
river to the neighborhood of New Orleans, was still
detained before Fort Pillow, one of the outlying defenses
of Memphis, forty miles above the latter city
and over eight hundred from New Orleans. It was
not until the end of May that the evacuation of
Corinth by the Confederates made Memphis untenable,
leading to the abandonment of the forts on the
4th of June and the surrender of the city on the following
day. It became therefore incumbent upon
Farragut, after turning over the command of New
Orleans to Butler on the 1st of May, to go up the
river as soon as he possibly could.</p>

<p>Although the flag-officer seems to have acquiesced<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
in this programme in the beginning, it was probably
with the expectation that the advance, up river and
against the current, required of his heavy-draught and
slow-moving ships would not be very far; that the
Cairo expedition, which at the date of the orders
quoted, January 20th, had not begun to move, would,
from the character of the vessels composing it, many
being ironclad, and from the advantage of the
current, have progressed very far by the time he
had taken New Orleans. Moreover, at that date the
upper river flotilla was still a branch of the army,
and its prospective movements were to be in combination
with, and a part of, a great military enterprise,
securing control both of the stream and of the
land; whereas Farragut's was a purely naval operation,
to which the army contributed only a force
sufficient to hold the points which were first reduced
by the fleet.</p>

<p>Under the actual conditions, the proposed ascent
of the river bore a very different aspect to the commanding
naval officer on the spot from that which
presented itself to the fond imaginations of the officials
in Washington. The question now was not
one of fighting batteries, for there was no reason as
yet to expect anything heavier than the fleet had already
overcome with ease; it was the far more
difficult matter of communications, in the broadest
scope of the word, to be maintained over a long,
narrow, tortuous, and very difficult road, passing in
many places close under the guns of the enemy.
"As I stated in my last dispatch," wrote Farragut to
the department after his first visit to Vicksburg,
"the dangers and difficulties of the river have proved
to us, since we first entered it, much greater impedi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>ments
to our progress, and more destructive to our
vessels, than the enemy's shot. Between getting
aground, derangement of the machinery, and want
of coal, the delays in getting up the river are great."
To take the defenses in the rear, and in their then
state to drive the enemy out of them, was one thing;
but to hold the abandoned positions against the return
of the defenders, after the fleet had passed on,
required an adequate force which Butler's army, calculated
by McClellan for a much narrower sphere,
could not afford. Coal and supply ships, therefore,
must either run the gantlet for the four hundred
miles which separated Vicksburg from New Orleans,
or be accompanied always by armed vessels. The
former alternative was incompatible with the necessary
security, and for the latter the numbers of the
fleet were utterly inadequate. In fact, to maintain the
proposed operations, there would be needed so many
ships to guard the communications that there would
be none left for the operations to which they led.</p>

<p>It must also be observed that not only was this
line of communications four times as long as that
which led from the sea to New Orleans, and of far
more difficult pilotage, but that the natural character
of the enemy's positions upon it was essentially different.
They were as yet undeveloped by art; but
by nature they were high and commanding bluffs,
having secure land communications with an extensive
enemy's country in their rear over which our
troops exercised no control whatever&mdash;where they
had not even been seen. To speak of "taking them
in the rear" was to beg the question&mdash;to assume
that their front was then, as in June, 1863, toward
an enemy investing them on the land side. New<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Orleans and the region below, including its defenses
and the communications therewith, were low-lying and
intersected with numerous water-courses; over such
a navy naturally exercises a preponderating control.
Above New Orleans the low delta of the Mississippi
extends, indeed, on the west bank as far as the Red
River, if it may not be said to reach to Vicksburg
and beyond; but on the east bank it ceases one
hundred and fifty miles from the city. From thence
to Vicksburg, a distance of two hundred and fifty
miles, the stream is bordered by a series of bluffs
backing on a firm country of moderate elevation.
Such positions are not to be reduced from the water
alone. On the contrary, if the water be a narrow
strip swept by their guns, they command it; while,
from the extent of country in their rear, they are not
susceptible of isolation by fleets above and below,
as were Forts Jackson and St. Philip.</p>

<p>This series of bluffs became, therefore, the line
upon which the Confederates based their control of
the Mississippi and maintained their vital communications
with Texas and the Red River region. It
could be reduced only by a military force; and to
think of subduing it by a fleet taking advantage of
the panic following the fall of New Orleans, was
truly to rely upon moral effect without adequate
physical force to support it. It is due to the Navy
Department to say that they expected the army
from the North to advance more rapidly than it
did; but, without seeking to assign the blame, the
utterly useless penetration of the United States
fleet four hundred miles into the heart of the
enemy's country and its subsequent mortifying
withdrawal, when contrasted with the brilliant suc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>cess
resulting from Farragut's dash by the forts,
afford a very useful lesson in the adaptation of
means to ends and the selection of a definite objective,
upon compassing which something happens.
The object of the United States Government being
to control the lower Mississippi, that was effected
by means of isolating its defenses, which then fell.
When the further object was sought of controlling
the course of the stream above, the mere perambulation
of a body of ships effected nothing, because it
aimed at nothing in particular, and could have no
effect upon the decisive points.</p>

<p>Of all these considerations Farragut was fully
sensible; and, while he obeyed his orders, he showed
in his dispatches to the Department, and in private
letters of the same period, how much against his
judgment were operations conceived on such erroneous
military principles and undertaken with such
inadequate force. The Department was forward to
press him on, and as early as the 17th of May sent a
dispatch intimating that he had forgotten his orders
on the subject; and he was urged and required to
open up the Mississippi to Flag-officer Davis's command
(the Mississippi flotilla), then still above Memphis.
This and other letters of the same date must
have been peculiarly exasperating; for they were received
early in June, when he had been up the river
as far as Vicksburg and satisfied himself that without
an adequate force of troops nothing could
be accomplished. "The Department," he replies,
"seems to have considered my fleet as having escaped
all injury, and that when they arrived off New
Orleans they were in condition to be pushed up the
river. This was not the case; but, the moment the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
vessels could be gotten ready, the gunboats were all
sent up under the command of Commander S. P.
Lee, with directions to proceed to Vicksburg, take
that place, and cut the railroad.... From all I
could hear it was not considered proper, even with
pilots, to risk the ships beyond Natchez.... By the
time Commander Lee arrived at Vicksburg (May
18th) he was satisfied that the force of the enemy
was too great for him to venture to take the town,
or even to pass it. The land in the rear of Vicksburg
is about two hundred feet high, on which are
placed some eight and ten inch columbiads, which are
perfectly secure from our fire.... I determined to
get the heavy ships up there if possible, which I did
a day or two after. General Williams arrived in the
mean time with fifteen hundred men, when I proposed
to him, if he could carry the battery on the
hill, I would attack the town. He made a careful
reconnaissance, and returned to me in the afternoon,
when I had all the (naval) commanders assembled.
He reported that it would be impossible for him to
land, and that he saw no chance of doing anything
with the place so long as the enemy were in such
force, having at their command thirty thousand
men within one hour by railroad. A large majority
of the commanders concurred with him in the
opinion."</p>

<p>Writing to his home about this council, in which,
contrary to his independent decision when below
Fort Jackson, he yielded to the advice of his captains,
he said: "I did not pass Vicksburg; not
because it was too strongly fortified; not because
we could not have passed it easily enough, <i>but we
would have been cut off from our supplies of coal and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
provisions</i>. We would have been placed between two
enemies (Vicksburg and Memphis), and so the captains
advised me not to do it. I was very sick at
the time, and yielded to their advice, <i>which I think
was good</i>; but I doubt if I would have taken it had
I been well." Here is seen, transpiring vividly
enough, the uncertainty and indecision arising from
the conflict between the orders of the Department
and his own sounder judgment. He would fain
obey; yet no orders could override, though they
might cruelly embarrass, the responsibility of the
officer in command on the spot. "Fighting is nothing,"
he adds, "to the evils of the river&mdash;getting on
shore, running foul of one another, losing anchors,
etc." "The army," he resumes in his dispatch to
the Department, "had been sent up early with a few
days' rations, and I was compelled to supply them
from the squadron, thereby reducing our own supplies,
which were barely sufficient to bring the ships
back to New Orleans, making allowance for probable
delays. The river was now beginning to fall, and I
apprehended great difficulty in getting down should
I delay much longer. In the mean time coal vessels
had been towed up the river just above Natchez (a
hundred miles below Vicksburg), which vessels I was
obliged to bring down and keep in company with the
vessels of war, for fear of their being captured by
the guerrilla bands which appear to infest almost the
entire banks of the river wherever there are rapids
and bluffs."</p>

<p>Such were some of the difficulties being experienced
when the Assistant-Secretary of the Navy
was writing: "The <i>only</i> anxiety <i>we</i> feel is to know
if you have followed up your instructions and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
pushed a strong force up the river to meet the
Western flotilla." "I had no conception," replied
Farragut, "that the Department ever contemplated
that the ships of this squadron were to attempt to
go to Memphis, above which the Western flotilla
then was; nor did I believe it was practicable for
them to do so, unless under the most favorable circumstances,
in time of peace, when their supplies
could be obtained along the river. The gunboats
are nearly all so damaged that they are certainly
not in condition to contend with ironclad rams
coming down upon them with the current.... We
consider the advantage entirely in favor of the vessel
that has the current added to her velocity." In
conclusion he adds: "I arrived in New Orleans with
five or six days' provisions and one anchor, and am
now trying to procure others. As soon as provisions
and anchors are obtained we will take our departure
for up the river, and endeavor to carry out, as far as
practicable, the orders conveyed in your different
dispatches." Writing home, he expressed himself
more freely and unmistakably: "They will keep us
in this river until the vessels break down and all the
little reputation we have made has evaporated. The
Government appears to think that we can do anything.
They expect me to navigate the Mississippi
nine hundred miles in the face of batteries, ironclad
rams, etc., and yet with all the ironclad vessels they
have North they could not get to Norfolk or Richmond....
Well, I will do my duty to the best of
my ability, and let the rest take care of itself....
They can not deprive me and my officers of the historical
fact that we took New Orleans. Now they
expect impossibilities."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Enough has been quoted to show that Farragut
was in no way responsible for, nor approved of, the
ill-timed tenacity with which the Government held
to its original plan, when the conditions had turned
out entirely different from those at first expected.
The Secretary of the Navy at a later date endeavored
to throw the blame of failure entirely upon the War
Department, which was either unwilling or unable to
support the naval movement with adequate troops.
It is not necessary, in a life of the admiral, to attempt
to decide upon the degree of remissness, if
any, shown by the military service, nor upon whose
shoulders it falls. It is sufficient to point out that
the Navy Department required of Farragut to go up
to meet the Western flotilla when it was near nine
hundred miles from the mouth of the Mississippi,
for no better reason, apparently, than that it had determined
upon the junction at a time when it supposed
it would be effected much lower down. In so
doing it left nothing to the judgment of the officer
commanding on the spot. "I think," said Farragut
quietly, "that more should have been left to my discretion;
but I hope for the best, and pray God to
protect our poor sailors from harm." His own opinion
was that Mobile should be the next point attacked.
The difficulties there were not so great as
those encountered at the Mississippi forts; and his
success at the latter might not improbably have considerable
moral effect upon the other works, whose
position had some strong features of resemblance to
those already subdued, and which were not yet in the
strong state of defense which they afterward reached.
The blockade of the coast was part of his charge;
and in no way did he think it could be so thoroughly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
maintained as by occupying the harbors themselves,
or their entrances.</p>

<p>In obedience to his peremptory orders Farragut
again started up the river, with the apprehension
that if he once got above Vicksburg he would not be
able to return before the next spring rise; for the
season of lowest water in the Mississippi was now at
hand. The Hartford did run ashore on the way up,
and remained hard and fast for the better part of
twenty-four hours. "It is a sad thing to think of
having your ship on a mud bank, five hundred miles
from the natural element of a sailor," wrote the flag-officer;
"but I knew that I had done all I could to prevent
her being up the river so high, and was commanded
to go." She had to take out her coal and
shot, and had even removed two guns before she
floated.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June the squadron was assembled
just below Vicksburg, having in company also seventeen
schooners of the mortar flotilla, still under
Porter's command. These were placed as rapidly
as possible in suitable positions on the two sides
of the river, opened fire on the 26th, and continued
it through the 27th. Upon the evening of the
latter day Porter notified the flag-officer that he was
ready to cover, by a steady bombardment, the intended
passage of the fleet before the batteries.</p>

<p>Vicksburg is situated on the first high land met
on the east bank of the Mississippi after leaving
Memphis, from which it is four hundred miles distant.
The position was one of peculiar strength and
importance for commanding the navigation of the
river. Not only was it exceptionally lofty, and on
one flank of that series of bluffs which has before<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
been mentioned as constituting the line upon which
the Confederate grip of the stream was based, but
the tortuous character of the channel gave particular
facilities for an enfilading fire on vessels both before
and after they came abreast the works. They were
thus exposed to a longer and more dangerous cannonade
than is the case where the stream flows
straight past the front of a battery. The channel
has now changed; but in 1862 the river, which from
Memphis had pursued its winding course through
an alluvial country, made when abreast of Vicksburg
a sharp turn to the northeast, as though determined
to reach the bluffs but four miles distant. As it
neared them it swung round with a sharp turn to
the southwest, parallel to its recent direction, flowing
for the most part close to the foot of the hills.
Between the two reaches, and formed by them, immediately
opposite the town, there was a low tongue
of land, or promontory, four miles long and less
than one wide. The squadron, being below, had to
steam up through the lower reach against the current,
make the sharp turn at the bend, and then pass
through the upper reach. In the bend it was followed
by a fire from the highest part of the bluffs,
to which it could make no reply.</p>

</div>

<p style="margin-top: 2em">At 2 <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span> of June 28th the signal was given, and
at three the squadron was under way&mdash;eleven vessels,
of which three were the heavy ships Hartford,
Richmond, and Brooklyn; two, the corvettes Iroquois
and Oneida; and six gunboats. At four, the ships in
their slow progress, stemming the current, had passed
the mortar schooners; and the latter then opened
fire, as did the steamers connected with them, which
were not to attempt the passage. Owing to a mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>understanding,
the three vessels which formed the
rear of the column, the Brooklyn and two gunboats,
did not get by. The others, at 6 <span class="smcap">a.&nbsp;m.</span>, anchored
above Vicksburg. Though exposed much of the
time to a raking fire, to which they were not able to
reply, the vessels suffered less than would have been
expected, owing to the enemy falling into the common
mistake of giving too much elevation to his
guns. Having thus accomplished his instructions,
Farragut reported coldly to the Department that, in
obedience to the orders "and the command of the
President, I proceeded up to Vicksburg with the
Brooklyn, Richmond, and Hartford, with the determination
to carry out my instructions to the best of
my ability.... The Department will perceive from
this report that the forts can be <i>passed</i>, and <i>we have
done it</i>, and can <i>do it again as often as may be required</i>
of us. It will not, however, be an easy matter for
us to do more than silence the batteries for a time,
as long as the enemy has a large force behind the
hills to prevent our landing and holding the place."
"I am satisfied," he says again, "it is not possible
to take Vicksburg without an army of twelve or
fifteen thousand men. General Van Dorn's division
(Confederate) is here, and lies safely behind the hills.
The water is too low for me to go over twelve or
fifteen miles above Vicksburg." The last sentence
reveals clearly enough the madness of attempting to
take three of the best ships of the navy to the upper
river in falling water. Fortunately the insufficient
depth now was above&mdash;not below&mdash;them, and they
were not utterly cut off from the sea. Commander
Porter, however, who started down river a week later,
in compliance with orders summoning him to Wash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>ington,
and than whom the navy had no more active
nor enterprising officer, wrote back to the flag-officer
that if the big ships did not soon return he feared
they would have to remain till next year.</p>

<p>Three days after Farragut passed the batteries of
Vicksburg, on the 1st of July, the Mississippi flotilla,
under the command of Flag-officer Charles H. Davis,
joined him from above; having left Memphis only
two days before, but favored in their voyage by the
current, by competent pilots, and by a draught suited
to the difficulties of river navigation. The united
squadrons continued together until the 15th of July,
lying at anchor near the neck of the promontory opposite
Vicksburg; with the exception of the Brooklyn
and the two gunboats which had not passed up
on the 28th of June. These remained below the
works, and on the opposite side of the promontory.</p>

<p>The position of the two flag-officers was about
four miles below the mouth of the Yazoo River, a
tributary of the Mississippi, which enters the main
stream on the east side not far above Vicksburg. It
was known to them that there was somewhere in the
Yazoo an ironclad ram called the Arkansas; which,
more fortunate than the Mississippi at New Orleans,
had been hurried away from Memphis just before
that city fell into the hands of the United States
forces. She was a vessel of between eight hundred
and a thousand tons burden, carrying ten guns,
which were protected by three inches of railroad
iron, backed by bales of compressed cotton firmly
braced. Her most dangerous weapon, however, was
her ram; but, owing to the lightness and bad construction
of the engines, this was not as formidable as
it otherwise might have been to the enemy's ships.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>

<p>So little injury had thus far been done to the
United States vessels by the rams of the Confederates
that the two flag-officers were probably lulled
into a state of over-security, and they allowed their
squadrons to lie with too low fires. To this doubtless
contributed the more powerful motive of the
difficulty to the coal supply incurred by the excessively
long line of exposed communications, imposed
upon both squadrons by the stubborn persistence
of the Navy Department in hurrying the fleets
far in advance of any support by the army. Beyond
the reach of their guns they could not control the
river banks; and, unless they could be present everywhere
along the eight hundred miles which separated
Memphis from New Orleans, even the narrow strip
on either side swept by their cannon was safe at any
point only while they were abreast it. The moral
effect of their promenade up and down and of their
meeting at Vicksburg was accurately weighed by the
enemy; and, however it may have imposed upon the
Northern people, did nothing to insure the safety
of the unarmed vessels upon which supplies depended.
This essentially vicious military situation
resulted necessarily in a degree of insecurity which
could have but one issue&mdash;a retreat by both squadrons
toward their respective bases, which soon after
followed.</p>

<p>Convinced of the inutility of his own presence at
Vicksburg, and preoccupied with the risks threatening
his squadron from the unguarded state of the river
and its dangerous navigation, it is not wonderful
that Farragut, who was the senior of the two flag-officers,
thought little of the single ironclad vessel
in his neighborhood. He was not prone to exag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>gerate
danger, and his experience had not led him
to entertain any high opinion of the enemy's rams.
To these circumstances he owed one of the most
mortifying incidents of his career.</p>

<p>On the 15th of July a reconnoitering expedition
was sent into the Yazoo, composed of two vessels
of Davis's squadron, accompanied by one of the
rams which at that time formed an independent organization
upon the upper Mississippi under the
command of Colonel Ellet. It was a fortunate
move, for to this circumstance was due that the
squadrons had any notice of the approach of the
Arkansas. The detached vessels met her about six
miles within the Yazoo, when a running fight ensued
between her and the Carondelet, to the disadvantage
of the United States vessel; but the sustained cannonade
attracted betimes the attention of the fleet,
and the Tyler, a small unarmored boat, after supporting
the Carondelet to the best of her ability
through the action, preceded the combatants down
stream, bringing tidings of the ram's approach.
There was not time to raise steam&mdash;only to cast
loose the guns for action. When the Arkansas
reached the fleet her smoke-stack had been so often
perforated by the Carondelet's shot that her boilers
could scarcely supply any steam. Her speed was
thereby reduced to one knot, powerless to ram and
scarcely sufficient to steer. At that rate, with the
favor also of the current, she passed through the
United States vessels, suffering from their successive
fires much injury, though not of a vital kind, and
took refuge under the guns of Vicksburg. It was
a most gallant exploit, fairly comparable in daring
to the passage of the Mississippi forts, but re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>sulting
in no decisive effect upon the issues of
the war.</p>

<p>It became immediately advisable for Farragut to
rejoin the three ships which lay below the town, and
were consequently in a condition favoring an attack
by the ram, whose apparent immunity under the
fire of the two squadrons showed her an enemy not
to be despised. He determined to follow her down
at once, again passing the batteries, and endeavoring
to destroy her with the guns of his squadron as
it went by. The execution of the plan was set
for the late afternoon, and the Mississippi flotilla
took up a position to support the movement by engaging
the upper batteries. Unfortunately, time
was lost in forming the order of battle, and the passage
was effected in the dark. The uncertainty of
aim thus caused was increased by the precaution of
the enemy, who shifted his position after nightfall.
Two shots only found her, injuring several of her
people and setting fire to the cotton bulwarks. Beyond
this she received no injury at this time, but
she had been severely shaken by the hammering of
the morning. A week later, on the 22d of July,
Davis sent down the Essex, one of his heavy ironclads,
accompanied by one of Ellet's rams, to attack
the Arkansas at her moorings. The effort was unsuccessful,
although the enemy's vessel received
some further injury. The ram rejoined the upper
squadron; but the Essex, from her indifferent speed,
was unable to return against the current, exposed
unsupported to the fire of all the batteries. She
therefore became thenceforth a member of the lower
squadron, together with a ram called the Sumter,
which had run down with Farragut on the 15th.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span></p>

<p>On the 20th of the month Farragut had received
orders from the Navy Department, dated July 14th,
directing him to get the part of his fleet above Vicksburg
below that place with as little injury and loss
of life as possible. The circumstances that have
been narrated caused him to receive this dispatch
below the town; and on the 24th, two days after the
descent of the Essex, he departed for New Orleans.
Davis assured him that the Essex and Sumter should
look out for the river between Vicksburg and Baton
Rouge. To them were joined three of Farragut's
gunboats; and the five vessels took an active part in
supporting the garrison of Baton Rouge when an attack
was made upon the place by the Confederates
on the 5th of August. In this the Arkansas was to
have co-operated with the enemy's troops, and she
left Vicksburg on the 3d for that purpose; but her
machinery broke down, and while lying helpless
against the river bank the Essex came in sight. Resistance
in her then plight was hopeless. She was
set on fire by her commander, the crew escaping to
the shore. Farragut himself reached Baton Rouge
shortly after this happened. He had with much
difficulty succeeded in getting the heavier ships to
New Orleans on the 28th of July; and there he had
lingered, unwilling to leave the river, though desirous
of doing so, until affairs seemed on a reasonably secure
basis. The chief element of anxiety was the
Arkansas, concerning whose power to harm quite
exaggerated notions prevailed. While thus lying before
New Orleans word was brought him of the attack
on Baton Rouge, and he at once retraced his
steps with the Hartford, Brooklyn, and some smaller
ships. On the 7th he reached the scene of action,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and learned the destruction of the Confederate vessel.
The same day he wrote to the Department: "It
is one of the happiest moments of my life that I am
enabled to inform the Department of the destruction
of the ram Arkansas; not because I held the iron-clad
in such terror, but because the community did."
It must have been an additional element of satisfaction
to him that the disappearance from the waters
of the Mississippi of the last hostile vessel capable
of offensive action released him from the necessity
of remaining himself, or of keeping a large force
there, during the unhealthy season.</p>

<p>Before leaving Vicksburg the crews of the fleet
had suffered severely from the sickness common in
that climate. The Brooklyn had sixty-eight sick out
of a total of three hundred; and as this proportion
was less than in the upper river flotilla, where the
sick numbered forty per cent of the total force, it is
probable that it fairly represents the general condition
of Farragut's ships. Among the troops accompanying
the expedition there were but eight hundred
fit for duty out of over three thousand. It was
not considered well to maintain for a longer time in
Baton Rouge the small garrison hitherto stationed
there. It had honorably repulsed the enemy's attack;
but, in the general cessation of offensive movements
by the United States army, the Confederates
were continually strengthening their forces on the
line of bluffs south of Vicksburg, to the importance
of which their attention, never entirely diverted, had
been forcibly drawn by the advance of the fleet in
the previous months. Fruitless as that ill-judged
advance had been, it reminded the enemy of the
serious inconvenience they would suffer if the United<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
States ships could freely patrol that part of the Mississippi,
and impressed upon them the necessity of
securing a section of it, by which they could have
undisturbed communication between the two shores.
This could be done by fortifying two points in such
strength that to pass them from either direction
would involve a risk too great to be lightly undertaken.
The points chosen were Vicksburg and Port
Hudson, two hundred miles apart, and embracing
between them the mouth of the Red River. The
latter is the great artery of the region west of the
Mississippi, and also, by means of the Atchafalaya
Bayou, offers direct communication for light-draught
vessels with the Gulf of Mexico. Port Hudson being
less than twenty miles from Baton Rouge, the presence
in the latter of a small garrison, which could
undertake no offensive movement and which there
were no troops to re-enforce, became purposeless. On
the 16th of August, 1862, the post was abandoned,
and the troops occupying it withdrew to New Orleans.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

1862-1863.</h3>


<p>Operations in the Mississippi having now temporarily
ceased, Farragut was at liberty to give his
undivided attention for a time to the coast blockade.
The important harbor of Pensacola had been
evacuated by the Confederates in May, less than a
month after the capture of New Orleans. Its abandonment
was due to want of troops to garrison it
properly; the pressure of the United States armies
in Kentucky and Tennessee, after the fall of Fort
Donelson in the previous February, having necessitated
the withdrawal of all men that could be spared
from other points. Before the war Pensacola had
been the seat of a well-equipped navy yard with a
good dry-dock, the only naval station of the United
States in the Gulf of Mexico. At the time of the
evacuation the buildings in the yard had been destroyed
and the dry-dock injured; but the fine harbor,
the depth of water&mdash;twenty-two feet&mdash;that could
be carried over the bar, and the nearness of the port
to Mobile, the most important center of blockade
running, all combined to make it the headquarters of
the fleet for repairs and supplies. Farragut arrived
there on the 20th of August. Just before leaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
New Orleans he received his commission as rear
admiral, dated July 16, 1862. Three other officers
were promoted at the same time to the active list of
this grade, which had never before existed in the
United States; but as Farragut was the senior in
rank of the four, he may be said to have been the
first officer of the navy to hoist an admiral's flag.</p>

<p>The admiral remained in Pensacola for three
months, superintending from there the affairs of his
squadron. During this period the harbors of Galveston
and of various other smaller ports on the
coast of Texas and <a name="Page_197t" id="Page_197t"></a><a href="#Page_197tn">Louisiana</a> were occupied by detachments
of vessels, as the surest way of enforcing
the blockade. The admiral had early announced
that he should carry on the blockade as far as possible
inside; and these successes enabled him to say
in December, 1862, that he now held the whole coast
except Mobile. During his stay in Pensacola he received
a visit from his son, who found him in the
best of spirits, all having gone well on the coast;
the only mishap having been the success of a Confederate
cruiser, the Oreto, in running into Mobile.
She had availed herself of her close resemblance to
some of the British cruisers in the Gulf to hoist the
British flag; and as visits of these vessels to the blockaded
ports were authorized and not infrequent, the
ruse induced the United States ship that overhauled
her to withhold its fire for a few critical moments.
During these the Oreto gained so far on the other
that, although struck three times by heavy projectiles,
she received no vital injury and succeeded in
gaining the shelter of the forts.</p>

<p>The period of the admiral's stay in Pensacola was
one of the deepest depression to the Union cause,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and his letters bear evidence of the anxiety which he
shared with all his fellow-countrymen in that time of
distress. The reverses of McClellan in the peninsula,
followed by the withdrawal of his army from
thence and its transference to northern Virginia, the
defeats suffered by Pope, and the first invasion of
Maryland, occurred either immediately before or
during the time that Farragut was in Pensacola. His
own bootless expedition up the Mississippi and subsequent
enforced retirement conspired also to swell
the general gloom; for, although thinking military
men could realize from the first that the position
into which the fleet was forced was so essentially
false that it could not be maintained, the unreflecting
multitude saw only the conversion into repulse and
disaster of a substantial success, of a conquest as
apparently real as it was actually phantasmal. In
the West, Grant was so stripped of troops that he
feared the possibility of the Union forces being
obliged to withdraw behind the Ohio, as they had in
the East recrossed the Potomac. "The most anxious
period of the war to me," he afterward wrote, "was
during the time the army of the Tennessee was
guarding the territory acquired by the fall of Corinth
and Memphis, and before I was sufficiently
re-enforced to take the offensive"&mdash;from July 15 to
October 15, 1862.</p>

<p>The Confederate forces which confronted Grant
in northern Mississippi during these anxious months
interposed between him and Vicksburg, and belonged
to the department charged with the defenses of the
Mississippi river. As they touched Grant, therefore,
on the one side, on the other they were in contact
with Farragut's command. The summer passed in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
various movements by them, threatening Grant's
position at Corinth, which culminated on the 3d of
October in an attack in force. This was repulsed
after hard fighting, and re-enforcements to Grant
beginning to come in, the Confederates themselves
were thrown on the defensive. The approach of
winter, bringing with it higher water and healthier
weather on the line of the Mississippi, warned them
also that the time was at hand when they might have
to fight for the control of the water communications,
upon which they no longer had, nor could hope to
have, a naval force. Reports therefore began to
reach the admiral in Pensacola, from the senior
naval officer in the river, that the Confederates were
with renewed energy building batteries above Baton
Rouge and strongly fortifying Port Hudson.</p>

<p>As there seemed no speedy prospect of obtaining
the land force, without whose co-operation an attack
upon Mobile would be a fruitless enterprise, Farragut
felt his proper position was now in the Mississippi
itself. Important as was the blockade service,
it was of a character safely to be trusted to a subordinate;
whereas the strictly military operations of
the approaching campaign, whatever shape they
might finally take, would be for the control of the
river. It therefore behooved the commander-in-chief
of the naval forces to be at hand, ready to
support in any way that might offer the effort to
obtain control of a region of which the water communications
were so characteristic a feature. To
push far up a narrow and intricate river a force of
ships, whose numbers are insufficient even to protect
their own communications and insure their coal supplies,
is one thing; it is quite another to repair to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
the same scene of action prepared to support the
army by controlling the water, and by establishing
in combined action a secure secondary base of operations
from which further advances can be made with
reasonable certainty of holding the ground gained.
There was no inconsistency between Farragut's reluctance
of the spring and his forwardness in the
autumn. The man who, to secure New Orleans and
compass the fall of the forts, had dared to cut adrift
from his base and throw his communications to the
winds, because he had an object adequate to the
risk, was the same who, six weeks later, had testified
his anxiety about communications stretched too far
and to no purpose; and now, half a year after that
reluctant ascent of the river against his better judgment,
we find him eagerly planning to go up again,
establishing under the protection of the army an
advanced base, from which, with the supplies accumulated
at it, further movements may be contemplated
with a good chance of final success.</p>

<p>On the 14th of November Farragut reported to
the Navy Department his return to New Orleans. The
Government, however, had taken warning by the
fiasco of the previous season; and, far from urging
the admiral on, now sought to impress him with the
need for caution. As the great object of opening the
Mississippi and obtaining control of it remained, and
necessarily must remain, the first of the Government's
aims in the Southwest, the result of these instructions
was to give Farragut the discretion which
had before been denied him. He retained fully his convictions
of the summer. "I am ready for anything,"
he writes to the Department, "but desire troops
to hold what we get. General Butler urges me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
attack Port Hudson first, as he wishes to break up
that rendezvous before we go outside. It will take
at least five thousand men to take Port Hudson."
In the same spirit he writes home, "I am still doing
nothing but waiting for the tide of events, and doing
all I can to hold what I have"; and again, a week
later, "As Micawber says, I am waiting for something
to turn up, and in the mean time having
patience for the water to rise." Readiness to
act, but no precipitation; waiting for circumstances,
over which he had no control, to justify
acting, may be described as his attitude at this
moment.</p>

<p>On the 16th of December the arrival from the
north of General Banks to relieve General Butler&mdash;an
event which took Farragut much by surprise&mdash;gave
him the opportunity to show at once his own
ideas of the proper military steps to be taken. Banks
had brought re-enforcements with him; and three
days after his coming the admiral writes to the Department:
"I have recommended to General Banks
the occupation of Baton Rouge.... It is only
twelve or fifteen miles from Port Hudson, and is
therefore a fine base of operations. He has approved
of the move, and ordered his transports to
proceed directly to that point. I ordered Commander
James Alden, in the Richmond, with two gunboats,
to accompany them and cover the landing." Baton
Rouge is on the southernmost of the bluffs which in
rapid succession skirt the Mississippi below Vicksburg.
With an adequate garrison it became a base
of operations from which the army could move
against Port Hudson when the time came; and under
its protection the colliers and supplies necessary for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
the naval vessels in the advance could safely remain.</p>

<p>While waiting for the new commander of the
army to get fairly settled to work and ready for the
combined movement which Farragut was eager to
make, the latter was called upon to endure some
sharp disappointments. On the 1st of January, 1863,
the military forces in Galveston were attacked by
Confederate troops, and the naval vessels by a number
of river steamboats barricaded with cotton to
resist shells fired against them, and loaded with riflemen.
The garrison was captured, one of the gunboats
blown up by her own officers, and another surrendered
after her captain and first lieutenant had
been killed on her decks. The other vessels abandoned
the harbor. The affair was not only a disaster;
it was attended with discreditable circumstances,
which excited in the admiral indignation as
well as regret. Shortly afterward, two sailing vessels
of the squadron, charged with the blockade of
Sabine Pass, were also taken by cotton-clad steamers;
which to attack availed themselves of a calm day,
when the ships were unable to man&oelig;uvre. An unsuccessful
attempt was made after this to take Sabine
Pass; but both that place and Galveston remained
in the power of the enemy, and were not regained
until the final collapse of the Confederacy. Farragut
dispatched one of his most trusted and capable officers,
Commodore Henry H. Bell, formerly his chief-of-staff,
to re-establish the blockade of Galveston.
Arriving off the port toward night, Bell sent one of
his detachment, the Hatteras, a light side-wheel iron
steamer bought from the merchant service, to overhaul
a sail in the offing. Unfortunately, the stranger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
proved to be the Confederate steamer Alabama, far
superior in force to the Hatteras, and after a short
engagement the latter was sunk.</p>

<p>All this bad news came in rapid succession, and
was closely followed by tidings of the escape from
Mobile of the Oreto, which a few months before had
eluded the blockading squadron through the daring
ruse practiced by her commander. Known now as
the Florida, and fitted as a Confederate cruiser, she
ran out successfully during the night of January 15th.
Here again, though the discredit was less than at
Galveston, the annoyance of the admiral was increased
by the knowledge that carelessness, or, at the
best, bad judgment, had contributed to the enemy's
success. From a letter written home at this time by
his son, who had not yet returned from the visit begun
at Pensacola, it appears that in the intimacy of family
life he admitted, and showed by his manner, how
keenly he felt the discredit to his command from
these events. Though conscious that they were not
due to failure on his part to do his utmost with the
force given to him, and seeing in the escape of the
Oreto a further justification of his own opinion that
the lower harbor of Mobile should have been early
seized, he nevertheless was "very much worried."
This inside view of the effect, visible to those from
whom he had no concealments, is supplemented by
the description of the admiral's bearing under these
reverses given by Captain (now Rear-Admiral) Jenkins,
who at this time became his chief-of-staff.
"These disasters," he writes, "were sore trials to the
admiral, and a less well-poised man would have given
way; but they seemed only to give him greater
strength of will and purpose.... I myself had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
misfortune, after months of watching, to see the
Oreto run out the first night after I had been relieved
of the command of the Oneida and ordered
to report to the admiral as his fleet-captain. I had
to bear him these bad tidings. Though no stoic,
he bore the news as one accustomed to misfortune."
It may seem, indeed, that these events, considered
individually, were but instances of the hard knocks
to be looked for in war, of which every general officer
in every campaign must expect to have his
share; and this view is undoubtedly true. Nevertheless,
occurring in such rapid succession, and all
in that part of his extensive command, the blockade,
to which at that moment it seemed impossible to
give his principal attention, the effect was naturally
staggering. His first impulse was to leave the river
and repair in person to the scene of disaster in Texas;
but reflection soon convinced him that, however unfortunate
the occurrences that had taken place there
and elsewhere on the coast, they had not the same
vital bearing on the issues of the war as the control
of the Mississippi, and therefore not an equal claim
upon the commander-in-chief.</p>

<p>At the same time, the effect was to intensify the
desire to act&mdash;to redeem by success the blot which
failures had brought upon his command; and the
state of affairs elsewhere on the river was becoming
such as to justify enterprise by the reasonable hope
of substantial results. A series of circumstances
which have been often narrated, and nowhere in a
more interesting manner than by General Grant in
his personal memoirs, had led to the abandonment of
the movement by land upon Vicksburg by the Army
of the Tennessee, following the Mississippi Central<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Railroad. Instead of this original plan of campaign,
the Mississippi River was now adopted as the line of
advance and of communications. The first move
along this new line had been made by General Sherman,
who brought with him 32,000 troops, and on
the 26th of December, 1862, had landed on the low
ground between the mouth of the Yazoo and Vicksburg.
On the 29th the army assaulted the works on
the hills before them, but were repulsed. Sherman,
satisfied that the position there was too strong to be
carried, had determined to change his point of attack
to the extreme right of the enemy's line, higher up
the Yazoo; but the heavy rains which characterized
the winter of 1862-'63 in the Mississippi Valley made
untenable the ground on which the troops were, and
it became necessary to re-embark them. The transports
were then moved out into the Mississippi,
where they were joined by General McClernand, the
senior general officer in the department under Grant
himself.</p>

<p>McClernand now decided to attack Arkansas
Post, on the Arkansas River, which enters the Mississippi
from the west about two hundred miles
above Vicksburg. The Post was primarily intended
to close the Arkansas and the approach to the capital
of the State of the same name; but although fifty
miles from the mouth of the river, it was, by the
course of the stream, but fifteen by land from the
Mississippi. The garrison, being five thousand
strong, was thus dangerously placed to threaten the
communications by the latter river, upon which the
army was to depend during the approaching campaign;
and it had already given evidence of the fact
by the capture of a valuable transport. This post<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
was reduced on the 11th of January, and McClernand
next day started troops up the White River, a tributary
of the Arkansas. From this ex-centric movement,
which seemed wholly to ignore that Vicksburg
and the Mississippi were the objective of the campaign,
McClernand was speedily and peremptorily
recalled by Grant. The latter, having absolutely no
confidence in the capacity of his senior subordinate,
could dispossess him of the chief command only by
assuming it himself. This he accordingly did, and
on the 30th of January joined the army, which was
then encamped on the levees along the west bank of
the river above Vicksburg.</p>

<p>Serious action on the part of the army, directed
by a man of whose vigorous character there could
be no doubt, though his conspicuous ability was not
yet fully recognized, was evidently at hand; and
this circumstance, by itself alone, imparted a very
different aspect to any naval enterprises, giving them
reasonable prospect of support and of conducing
substantially to the great common end. Never in
the history of combined movements has there been
more hearty co-operation between the army and
navy than in the Vicksburg campaign of 1863, under
the leadership of Grant and Porter. From the nature
of the enemy's positions their forcible reduction was
necessarily in the main the task of the land forces;
but that the latter were able to exert their full
strength, unweakened, and without anxiety as to
their long line of communications from Memphis to
Vicksburg, was due to the incessant vigilance and
activity of the Mississippi flotilla, which grudged
neither pains nor hard knocks to support every
movement. But, besides the care of our own com<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>munications,
there was the no less important service
of harassing or breaking up those of the enemy. Of
these, the most important was with the States west of
the Mississippi. Not to speak of cereals and sugar,
Texas alone, in the Southwest, produced an abundance
of vigorous beef cattle fit for food; and from
no other part of the seceded States could the armies
on the east banks of the Mississippi be adequately
supplied. Bordering, moreover, upon Mexico, and
separated from it only by a shoal river into which the
United States ships could not penetrate, there poured
across that line quantities of munitions of war, which
found through the Mexican port of Matamoras a
safe entry, everywhere else closed to them by the
sea-board blockade. For the transit of these the
numerous streams west of the Mississippi, and
especially the mighty Red River, offered peculiar
facilities. The principal burden of breaking up these
lines of supply was thrown upon the navy by the
character of the scene of operations&mdash;by its numerous
water-courses subsidiary to the great river itself,
and by the overflow of the land, which, in its deluged
condition during the winter, effectually prevented
the movement of troops. Herein Farragut
saw his opportunity, as well as that of the upper
river flotilla. To wrest the control of the Mississippi
out of the enemy's hands, by reducing his positions,
was the great aim of the campaign; until that
could be effected, the patrol of the section between
Vicksburg and Port Hudson would materially conduce
to the same end.</p>

<p>Over this Farragut pondered long and anxiously.
He clearly recognized the advantage of this service,
but he also knew the difficulties involved in main<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>taining
his necessary communications, and, above
all, his coal. At no time did the enemy cease their
annoyance from the river banks. Constant brushes
took place between their flying batteries and the different
gunboats on patrol duty; a kind of guerrilla
warfare, which did not cease even with the fall of
Vicksburg and Port Hudson, but naturally attained
its greatest animation during the months when their
fate was hanging in the balance. The gunboats
could repel such attacks, though they were often
roughly handled, and several valuable officers lost
their lives; but not being able to pursue, the mere
frustration of a particular attack did not help to
break up a system of very great annoyance. Only
a force able to follow&mdash;in other words, troops&mdash;could
suppress the evil. "You will no doubt hear more,"
the admiral writes on the 1st of February, 1863, "of
'Why don't Farragut's fleet move up the river?'
Tell them, Because the army is not ready. Farragut
waits upon Banks as to when or where he will go."</p>

<p>Still, even while thus dancing attendance upon a
somewhat dilatory general, his plans were maturing;
so that when occasion arose he was, as always, ready
for immediate action&mdash;had no unforeseen decision to
make. "The evening of the day (about January
20th) that I reported to him at New Orleans," writes
Admiral Jenkins, "he sent everybody out of the
cabin, and said: 'I wish to have some confidential
talk with you upon a subject which I have had in mind
for a long time.... I have never hinted it to any
one, nor does the department know anything of my
thoughts. The first object to be accomplished, which
led me to think seriously about it, is to cripple the
Southern armies by cutting off their supplies from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
Texas. Texas at this time is, and must continue to
the end of the war to be, their main dependence for
beef cattle, sheep, and Indian corn. If we can get a
few vessels above Port Hudson the thing will not be
an entire failure, and I am pretty confident it can be
done.'" Jenkins naturally suggested that the co-operation
of the army by an active advance at the
same time would materially assist the attempt. To
this, of course, the admiral assented, it being in entire
conformity with his own opinion; and several
interviews were held, without, however, their leading
to any definite promise on the part of General
Banks.</p>

<p>Meantime Admiral Porter, who after leaving the
mortar flotilla had been appointed to the command
of the Mississippi squadron, with the rank of acting
rear-admiral, realized as forcibly as Farragut the
importance of placing vessels in the waters between
Vicksburg and Port Hudson. In the middle of December
he was before Vicksburg, and had since then
been actively supporting the various undertakings
of the land forces. Three days after Grant joined
the army, on the 2d of February, the ram Queen of
the West ran the Vicksburg batteries from above,
and successfully reached the river below. Ten days
later, Porter sent on one of his newest ironclads, the
Indianola, which made the same passage under cover
of night without being even hit, although twenty
minutes under fire. The latter vessel took with her
two coal barges; and as the experiment had already
been successfully tried of casting coal barges loose
above the batteries, and trusting to the current to
carry them down to the Queen of the West, the
question of supplies was looked upon as settled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
The Indianola was very heavily armed, and both the
admiral and her commander thought her capable of
meeting any force the enemy could send against her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, on the 14th of February, two days
only after the Indianola got down, the Queen of the
West was run ashore under a battery and allowed to
fall alive into the hands of the enemy. The latter at
once repaired the prize, and, when ready, started in
pursuit of the Indianola with it and two other steamers;
one of which was a ram, the other a cotton-protected
boat filled with riflemen. There was also with them
a tender, which does not appear to have taken part
in the fight. On the night of February 24th the pursuers
overtook the Indianola, and a sharp action
ensued; but the strength of the current and her own
unwieldiness placed the United States vessel at a
disadvantage, which her superior armament did not, in
the dim light, counterbalance. She was rammed six
or seven times, and, being then in a sinking condition,
her commander ran her on the bank and surrendered.
This put an end to Porter's attempts to secure that
part of the river by a detachment. The prospect,
that had been fair enough when the Queen of the
West was sent down, was much marred by the loss
of that vessel; and the subsequent capture of the Indianola
transferred so much power into the hands of
the Confederates, that control could only be contested
by a force which he could not then afford to
risk.</p>

<p>The up-river squadron having failed to secure the
coveted command of the river, and, besides, transferred
to the enemy two vessels which might become
very formidable, Farragut felt that the time had come
when he not only might but ought to move. He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
was growing more and more restless, more and more
discontented with his own inactivity, when such an
important work was waiting to be done. The news
of the Queen of the West's capture made him still
more uneasy; but when that was followed by the loss
of the Indianola, his decision was taken at once.
"The time has come," he said to Captain Jenkins;
"there can be no more delay. I must go&mdash;army or
no army." Another appeal, however, was made to
Banks, representing the assistance which the squadron
would derive in its attempt to pass the batteries from
a demonstration made by the army. The permanent
works at Port Hudson then mounted nineteen heavy
cannon, many of them rifled; but there were reported
to be in addition as many as thirty-five field-pieces,
which, at the distance the fleet would have to pass,
would be very effective. If the army made a serious
diversion in the rear, many of these would be withdrawn,
especially if Farragut's purpose to run by
did not transpire. The advantage to be gained by
this naval enterprise was so manifest that the general
could scarcely refuse, and he promised to make
the required demonstration with eight or ten thousand
troops.</p>

<p>On the 12th of March, within a fortnight after
hearing of the Indianola affair, Farragut was off
Baton Rouge. On the 14th he anchored just above
Profit's Island, seven miles below Port Hudson,
where were already assembled a number of the mortar
schooners, under the protection of the ironclad
Essex, formerly of the upper squadron. The admiral
brought with him seven vessels, for the most
part essentially fighting ships, unfitted for blockade
duty by their indifferent speed, but carrying heavy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
batteries. If the greater part got by, they would
present a force calculated to clear the river of every
hostile steamer and absolutely prevent any considerable
amount of supplies being transferred from one
shore to the other.</p>

<p>For the purpose of this passage Farragut adopted
a somewhat novel tactical arrangement, which he
again used at Mobile, and which presents particular
advantages when there are enemies only on one side
to be engaged. Three of his vessels were screw
steamers of heavy tonnage and battery; three others
comparatively light. He directed, therefore, that
each of the former should take one of the latter on
the side opposite to the enemy, securing her well
aft, in order to have as many guns as possible, on
the unengaged side, free for use in case of necessity.
In this way the smaller vessels were protected without
sacrificing the offensive power of the larger.
Not only so; in case of injury to the boilers or engines
of one, it was hoped that those of her consort
might pull her through. To equalize conditions, to
the slowest of the big ships was given the most
powerful of the smaller ones. A further advantage
was obtained in this fight, as at Mobile, from this
arrangement of the vessels in pairs, which will be
mentioned at the time of its occurrence. The seventh
ship at Port Hudson, the Mississippi, was a very
large side-wheel steamer. On account of the inconvenience
presented by the guards of her wheel-houses,
she was chosen as the odd one to whom no
consort was assigned.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>Going up the river toward Port Hudson the course
is nearly north; then a bend is reached of over ninety
degrees, so that after making the turn the course
for some distance is west-southwest. The town is
on the east side, just below the bend. From it the
batteries extended a mile and a half down the river,
upon bluffs from eighty to a hundred feet high.
Between the two reaches, and opposite to the town,
is a low, narrow point, from which a very dangerous
shoal makes out. The channel runs close to the east
bank.</p>

<p>The squadron remained at its anchorage above
Profit's Island but a few hours, waiting for the cover
of night. Shortly before 10 <span class="smcap">p.&nbsp;m.</span> it got under way,
ranged as follows: Hartford, Richmond, Monongahela,
each with her consort lashed alongside, the
Mississippi bringing up the rear. Just as they were
fairly starting a steamer was seen approaching from
down the river, flaring lights and making the loud
puffing of the high-pressure engines. The flag-ship
slowed down, and the new arrival came alongside
with a message from the general that the army was
then encamped about five miles in rear of the Port
Hudson batteries. Irritated by a delay, which served
only to attract the enemy's attention and to assure
himself that no diversion was to be expected from
the army, the admiral was heard to mutter: "He
had as well be in New Orleans or at Baton Rouge for
all the good he is doing us." At the same moment
the east bank of the river was lit up, and on the opposite
point huge bonfires kindled to illumine the
scene&mdash;a wise precaution, the neglect of which by
the enemy had much favored the fleet in the passage
of the lower forts.</p>

<p>The ships now moved on steadily, but very
slowly, owing to the force of the current. At 11
<span class="smcap">p.&nbsp;m.</span> the Hartford had already passed the lower<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
batteries, when the enemy threw up rockets and
opened fire. This was returned not only by the advancing
ships, but also by the ironclad Essex and
the mortar schooners, which had been stationed to
cover the passage. The night was calm and damp,
and the cannonade soon raised a dense smoke which
settled heavily upon the water, covering the ships
from sight, but embarrassing their movements far
more than it disconcerted the aim of their opponents.
The flag-ship, being in the advance, drew somewhat
ahead of the smoke, although even she had from
time to time to stop firing to enable the pilot to see.
Her movements were also facilitated by placing the
pilot in the mizzen-top, with a speaking tube to communicate
with the deck, a precaution to which the
admiral largely attributed her safety; but the vessels
in the rear found it impossible to see, and groped
blindly, feeling their way after their leader. Had
the course to be traversed been a straight line, the
difficulty would have been much less; but to make
so sharp a turn as awaited them at the bend was no
easy feat under the prevailing obscurity. As the
Hartford attempted it the downward current caught
her on the port bow, swung her head round toward
the batteries, and nearly threw her on shore, her
stem touching for a moment. The combined powers
of her own engine and that of the Albatross, her consort,
were then brought into play as an oarsman uses
the oars to turn his boat, pulling one and backing the
other; that of the Albatross was backed, while that
of the Hartford went ahead strong. In this way their
heads were pointed up stream and they went through
clear; but they were the only ones who effected the
passage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>The Richmond, which followed next, had reached
the bend and was about to turn when a plunging
shot upset both safety valves, allowing so much
steam to escape that the engines could not be
efficiently worked. Thinking that the Genesee, her
companion, could not alone pull the two vessels by,
the captain of the Richmond turned and carried
them both down stream. The Monongahela, third
in the line, ran on the shoal opposite to the town
with so much violence that the gunboat Kineo,
alongside of her, tore loose from the fastenings.
The Monongahela remained aground for twenty-five
minutes, when the Kineo succeeded in getting her
off. She then attempted again to run the batteries,
but when near the turn a crank-pin became heated
and the engines stopped. Being now unmanageable,
she drifted down stream and out of action, having
lost six killed and twenty-one wounded. The Mississippi
also struck on the shoal, close to the bend,
when she was going very fast, and defied every
effort to get her off. After working for thirty-five
minutes, finding that the other ships had passed off
the scene leaving her unsupported, while three batteries
had her range and were hulling her constantly,
the commanding officer ordered her to be
set on fire. The three boats that alone were left
capable of floating were used to land the crew on
the west bank; the sick and wounded being first
taken, the captain and first lieutenant leaving the
ship last. She remained aground and in flames
until three in the morning, when she floated and
drifted down stream, fortunately going clear of the
vessels below. At half-past five she blew up. Out
of a ship's company of two hundred and ninety-<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>seven,
sixty-four were found missing, of whom
twenty-five were believed to be killed.</p>

<p>In his dispatch to the Navy Department, written
the second day after this affair, the admiral lamented
that he had again to report disaster to a part of
his command. A disaster indeed it was, but not of
the kind which he had lately had to communicate,
and to which the word "again" seems to refer; for
there was no discredit attending it. The stern
resolution with which the Hartford herself was
handled, and the steadiness with which she and her
companion were wrenched out of the very jaws of
destruction, offer a consummate example of professional
conduct; while the fate of the Mississippi, deplorable
as the loss of so fine a vessel was, gave rise
to a display of that coolness and efficiency in the
face of imminent danger which illustrate the annals
of a navy as nobly as do the most successful deeds of
heroism.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it must be admitted that the failure
to pass the batteries, by nearly three fourths of the
force which the admiral had thought necessary to
take with him, constituted a very serious check to
the operations he had projected. From Port Hudson
to Vicksburg is over two hundred miles; and
while the two ships he still had were sufficient to
blockade the mouth of the Red River&mdash;the chief line
by which supplies reached the enemy&mdash;they could not
maintain over the entire district the watchfulness
necessary wholly to intercept communication between
the two shores. Neither could they for the briefest
period abandon their station at the river's mouth,
without affording an opportunity to the enemy; who
was rendered vigilant by urgent necessities which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
forced him to seize every opening for the passage of
stores. From the repulse of five out of the seven
ships detailed for the control of the river, it resulted
that the enemy's communications, on a line absolutely
vital to him, and consequently of supreme
strategic importance, were impeded only, not broken
off. It becomes, therefore, of interest to inquire
whether this failure can be attributed to any oversight
or mistake in the arrangements made for forcing
the passage&mdash;in the tactical dispositions, to use
the technical phrase. In this, as in every case, those
dispositions should be conformed to the object to be
attained and to the obstacles which must be overcome.</p>

<p>The purpose which the admiral had in view was
clearly stated in the general order issued to his captains:
"The captains will bear in mind that the object
is <i>to run the batteries at the least possible damage to
our ships</i>, and thereby secure an efficient force above,
for the purpose of rendering such assistance as may
be required of us to the army at Vicksburg, or, if not
required there, to our army at Baton Rouge." Such
was the object, and the obstacles to its accomplishment
were twofold, viz., those arising from the difficulties
of the navigation, and those due to the preparations
of the enemy. To overcome them, it was
necessary to provide a sufficient force, and to dispose
that force in the manner best calculated to insure
the passage, as well as to entail the least exposure.
Exposure is measured by three principal
elements&mdash;the size and character of the target offered,
the length of time under fire, and the power of the
enemy's guns; and the last, again, depends not
merely upon the number and size of the guns, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
also upon the fire with which they are met. In this
same general order Farragut enunciated, in terse and
vigorous terms, a leading principle in warfare, which
there is now a tendency to undervalue, in the
struggle to multiply gun-shields and other defensive
contrivances. It is with no wish to disparage defensive
preparations, nor to ignore that ships must
be able to bear as well as to give hard knocks, that
this phrase of Farragut's, embodying the experience
of war in all ages and the practice of all great captains,
is here recalled, "The best protection against
the enemy's fire is a well-directed fire from our own
guns."</p>

<p>The disposition adopted for the squadron was
chiefly a development of this simple principle, combined
with an attempt to form the ships in such an
order as should offer the least favorable target to
the enemy. A double column of ships, if it presents
to the enemy a battery formidable enough to subdue
his fire, in whole or in part, shows a smaller target
than the same number disposed in a single column;
because the latter order will be twice as long in
passing, with no greater display of gun-power at a
particular point. The closer the two columns are together,
the less chance there is that a shot flying
over the nearer ship will strike one abreast her;
therefore, when the two are lashed side by side this
risk is least, and at the same time the near ship protects
the off one from the projectile that strikes herself.
These remarks would apply, in degree, if all the
ships of the squadron had had powerful batteries;
the limitation being only that enough guns must be
in the near or fighting column to support each other,
and to prevent several of the enemy's batteries being<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
concentrated on a single ship&mdash;a contingency dependent
upon the length of the line of hostile guns to be
passed. But when, as at Port Hudson, several of the
vessels are of feeble gun-power, so that their presence
in the fighting column would not re-enforce its
fire to an extent at all proportionate to the risk to
themselves, the arrangement there adopted is doubly
efficacious.</p>

<p>The dispositions to meet and overcome the difficulties
imposed by the enemy's guns amounted,
therefore, to concentrating upon them the batteries
of the heavy ships, supporting each other, and at the
same time covering the passage of a second column
of gunboats, which was placed in the most favorable
position for escaping injury. In principle the plan
was the same as at New Orleans&mdash;the heavy ships
fought while the light were to slip by; but in application,
the circumstances at the lower forts would
not allow one battery to be masked as at Port Hudson,
because there were enemy's works on both sides.
For meeting the difficulties of the navigation on this
occasion, Farragut seems not to have been pleased
with the arrangement adopted. "With the exception
of the assistance they might have rendered the
ships, if disabled, they were a great disadvantage,"
he wrote. The exception, however, is weighty; and,
taken in connection with his subsequent use of the
same order at Mobile, it may be presumed the sentence
quoted was written under the momentary
recollection of some inconvenience attending this
passage. Certainly, with single-screw vessels, as
were all his fleet, it was an inestimable advantage,
in intricate navigation or in close quarters, to have
the help of a second screw working in opposition to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the first, to throw the ship round at a critical instant.
In the supreme moment of his military life, at Mobile,
he had reason to appreciate this advantage, which he
there, as here, most intelligently used.</p>

<p>Thus analyzed, there is found no ground for adverse
criticism in the tactical dispositions made by
Farragut on this memorable occasion. The strong
points of his force were utilized and properly combined
for mutual support, and for the covering of
the weaker elements, which received all the protection
possible to give them. Minor matters of detail
were well thought out, such as the assignment to the
more powerful ship of the weaker gunboat, and the
position in which the small vessels were to be secured
alongside. The motto that "the best protection
against the enemy's fire is a well-directed fire by our
own guns" was in itself an epitome of the art of
war; and in pursuance of it the fires of the mortar
schooners and of the Essex were carefully combined
by the admiral with that of the squadron. Commander
Caldwell, of the Essex, an exceedingly cool
and intelligent officer, reported that "the effect of
the mortar fire (two hundred bombs being thrown in
one hundred and fifty minutes, from eleven to half-past
one) seemed to be to paralyze the efforts of the
enemy at the lower batteries; and we observed that
their fire was quite feeble compared to that of the
upper batteries." Nor had the admiral fallen into
the mistake of many general officers, in trusting too
lightly to the comprehension of his orders by his
subordinates. Appreciating at once the high importance
of the object he sought to compass, and the
very serious difficulties arising from the enemy's position
at Port Hudson and the character of the navi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>gation,
he had personally inspected the ships of his
command the day before the action, and satisfied
himself that the proper arrangements had been made
for battle. His general order had already been
given to each commanding officer, and he adds:
"We conversed freely as to the arrangements, and I
found that all my instructions were well understood
and, I believe, concurred in by all. After a free
interchange of opinions on the subject, every commander
arranged his ship in accordance with his own
ideas."</p>

<p>In this point the admiral appears to have made
a mistake, in not making obligatory one detail
which he employed on board the flag-ship. "I had
directed a trumpet fixed from the mizzen-top to the
wheel on board this ship, as I intended the pilot to
take his station in the top, so that he might see over
the fog, or smoke, as the case might be. To this
idea, and to the coolness and courage of my pilot,
Mr. Carrell, I am indebted for the safe passage of
this ship past the forts." It may be that the admiral
counted upon the vessels being so closed up that the
flag-ship would practically serve as the pilot for all.
If so, he reckoned without his host, and in this small
oversight or error in judgment is possibly to be found
a weak point in his preparations; but it is the only
one. The failure of the Richmond, his immediate
follower, was not in any way due to pilotage, but to
the loss of steam by an accidental shot; and it is
still a matter of doubt whether the Genesee, her consort,
might not have pulled her by. The third in the
order, the Monongahela, also failed finally from the
heating of a bearing; but as this occurred after
being aground for half an hour, with the vigorous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
working of the engines that naturally ensues under
such circumstances, it seems as if her failure must
ultimately be traced to the smoke. "The firing had
so filled the atmosphere with smoke," wrote her captain,
"as to prevent distinguishing objects near by."
The loss of the Mississippi was due entirely to an
error of the pilot, whatever may have been the
cause.</p>

<p>The effect of the appearance above Port Hudson
of the Hartford and Albatross is abundantly testified
in the correspondence of the day, both Union and
Confederate, and justifies beyond dispute this fine
conception of Farragut's and the great risk which he
took entirely upon his own responsibility. He found,
indeed, a ground for his action in an order of the
Department dated October 2, 1862,<a name="FNanchor_U_21" id="FNanchor_U_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_U_21" class="fnanchor">[U]</a> directing him
"to guard the lower part of the Mississippi, especially
where it is joined by the Red River," until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
he heard from Admiral Porter that the latter, in conjunction
with the army, had opened the river; but
he distrusted the consent of the Secretary to his
running the great risk involved in the passage of
Port Hudson. As Grant was ordered to take Vicksburg,
so was Farragut ordered to blockade the Red
River; and as Grant did not notify the commander-in-chief
of his final great resolve to cut loose from
his base, until it was too late to stop him, so did
Farragut keep within his own breast a resolve upon
which he feared an interdict. For even after two
years of war the department was embarrassed for
ships, and the policy of economy, of avoiding risks,
the ever fatal policy of a halting warfare, was forced
upon it&mdash;an impressive illustration of the effect exerted
by inadequate preparation upon the operations
of war. For lack of ships, Mobile was in 1863 still
in the hands of the enemy. "I would have had it
long since or been thrashed out of it," wrote Farragut
six weeks before Port Hudson. "I feel no fears
on the subject; <i>but they do not wish their ships risked,
for fear we might not be able to hold the Mississippi</i>."
A similar reluctance might be anticipated to expose
such valuable vessels as attacked Port Hudson, when
their loss was so hard to repair; for only men of the
temper of Farragut or Grant&mdash;men with a natural
genius for war or enlightened by their knowledge of
the past&mdash;can fully commit themselves to the hazard
of a great adventure&mdash;can fully realize that a course
of timid precaution may entail the greatest of risks.</p>


<p>"Your services at Red River," wrote Admiral
Porter to Farragut upon hearing of his arrival above
Port Hudson, "will be a godsend; it is worth to us
the loss of the "Mississippi," and is at this moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
the severest blow that could be struck at the South.
They obtain all their supplies and ammunition in
that way.... The great object is to cut off supplies.
For that reason I sent down the Queen of the West
and the Indianola. I regret that the loss of the
Indianola should have been the cause of your present
position." These utterances, which bespeak the relief
afforded him at the moment by Farragut's bold
achievement, are confirmed by the words written
many years later in his History of the Navy. "Farragut
in the Hartford, with the Albatross, reached
the mouth of the Red River, and Port Hudson was
as completely cut off from supplies as if fifty gunboats
were there.... It was soon seen that the object
aimed at had been gained&mdash;the works at Port
Hudson were cut off from supplies and the fate of
the garrison sealed." "I look upon it as of vast
importance," wrote General Grant, "that we should
hold the river securely between Vicksburg and Port
Hudson"; and he undertook to contribute anything
that the army could furnish to enable vessels from
above to run by Vicksburg, and so supply to Farragut
the numbers he needed through the repulse of
his own ships.</p>

<p>"The Mississippi is again cut off," wrote to
Richmond the Confederate General Pemberton, who
commanded the district in which are Vicksburg
and Port Hudson, "neither subsistence nor ordnance
can come or go"; and the following day,
March 20th, the sixth after Farragut's passage,
he sends word to General Richard Taylor, on the
west shore, "Port Hudson depends almost entirely
for supplies upon the other side of the river."
"Great God! how unfortunate!" writes, on March<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
17th, a Confederate commissary in Taylor's department.
"Four steamers arrived to-day from Shreveport.
One had 300,000 pounds of bacon; three
others are reported coming down with loads. Five
others are below with full cargoes designed for Port
Hudson, but it is reported that the Federal gunboats
are blockading the river." As to passing by other
points, "it is doubtful whether many cattle ever get
through the swamps and bayous through which they
are required to pass on this side. As the water declines,
I think likely cattle in large quantities can be
crossed by swimming, but <i>at present your prospect of
getting supplies from this side is gloomy enough</i>." "Early
in February," writes Pemberton again, "the enemy
succeeded in passing two of his gunboats by our
batteries at Vicksburg" (the Indianola and Queen of
the West). "This at once rendered the navigation of
the Mississippi and Red River dangerous, and from
that time it was only by watching opportunities, and
at great risk of capture, that supplies could be
thrown into Port Hudson and Vicksburg. Nevertheless,
large amounts were successfully introduced
into both places."</p>

<p>This success, partial as it was, was due, first, to
the capture of Porter's detachment, which opened the
river again until Farragut came; and, secondly, to the
repulse of so large a portion of the latter's squadron.
The Hartford and Albatross, though they could close
the Red River, could not multiply themselves to cover
the great stretch which the admiral had purposed to
occupy with seven vessels. Neither was the Albatross
of sufficient force to be left by herself at the mouth
of the Red River. Farragut therefore moved slowly
up the Mississippi, destroying a quantity of stores<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
accumulated upon the levees awaiting transportation,
as well as a number of flat-boats; and on the afternoon
of the 19th of March he anchored twelve miles
below Vicksburg. The following day he moved further
up and communicated with General Grant, informing
him of the events that had just befallen him
and offering any assistance in the power of the two
ships. If not needed, he purposed returning to Red
River, and asked for coal from either army or navy.
Porter was then absent on the Deer Creek expedition,
an attempt to get the Mississippi gunboats
through the bayou of that name into the Yazoo;
whereby, if successful, the Confederate position at
Vicksburg would be turned. Grant accordingly undertook
to send down coal, which was done by turning
adrift in the current of the Mississippi a barge
carrying some four hundred tons. This floated by
night clear of the enemy's positions, and was picked
up by boats from the Hartford.</p>

<p>Farragut had written to Porter of his wish to receive
some vessels from above, specifying two rams
and an ironclad, with which and his own two vessels
he could better carry out his purpose of closing the
whole stretch in which he was. He intimated this wish
to Grant, who highly approved of it. "I see by
Southern papers received yesterday," he wrote to Farragut,
"that Vicksburg must depend upon Louisiana,
or west of the Mississippi, for supplies. Holding Red
River from them is a great step in the direction of preventing
this, but it will not entirely accomplish the
object. New Carthage (twenty miles below Vicksburg,
on the west bank) should be held, and it seems
to me that in addition we should have sufficient vessels
below to patrol the whole river from Warrenton<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
(ten miles below Vicksburg) to the Red River. I will
have a consultation with Admiral Porter on this subject.
I am happy to say the admiral and myself
have never yet disagreed upon any policy." In the
absence of Porter, General Ellet determined to send
down two of the Ellet rams, which made their dash
on the morning of March 25, displaying all the daring,
but unfortunately also much of the recklessness,
which characterized that remarkable family. Starting
near dawn, on a singularly clear night, they were
surprised by daylight still under fire. One, being
very rotten, was shattered to pieces by a shell exploding
her boilers. The other was disabled, also
by a shell in the boilers, but, being stronger, drifted
down with the current and reached Farragut safely.
She was soon repaired, and was an addition to his
force.</p>

<p>While lying below Vicksburg the admiral transferred
to Porter's care, for passage north by the
Mississippi River, his son and only child, who had
been with him since the summer stay in Pensacola.
They had passed the batteries at Port Hudson together,
the bearing of the boy in that hot contest
approving itself to the father, who, despite his anxiety,
could not bring himself to accept the surgeon's
suggestion to send him below, out of harm's way.
"I am trying to make up my mind to part with
Loyall," he wrote to his wife, "and to let him go
home by way of Cairo. I am too devoted a father
to have my son with me in troubles of this kind.
The anxieties of a father should not be added to
those of the commander."</p>

<p>On the 27th of March the Hartford started again
down river, accompanied by the Albatross and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Ellet ram Switzerland. On the 2d of April the little
squadron anchored off the mouth of the Red River,
having on its passage down again destroyed a number
of skiffs and flat-boats used for transporting stores.
Warned by the fate of the Indianola, the admiral
left nothing undone to ensure the absolute safety of
the flag-ship; for, though her powerful armament
and numerous crew gave her a great superiority over
any number of river vessels, granting her room to
man&oelig;uvre, the difficulties of the river and the greatness
of the stake to both parties made it imperative
to take no needless risks. As a protection against
rams, large cypress logs were hung around the ship
about a foot above the water line, where they would
both resist penetration and also give time for the
elasticity of the frame of a wooden vessel to take up
the blow. Against boarding, elaborate preparations
were made, which would prevent a steamer attempting
it from getting nearer than twenty feet to the
side, where she would remain an easy victim to the
shell and grape of the Hartford's guns.</p>

<p>From the 2d to the 30th of April Farragut remained
in the neighborhood of the Red River, between
its mouth and Port Hudson. Cut off by the
batteries of the place, and by the prevalence of guerrillas
on the west bank, from all usual means of communication
with General Banks and his own squadron,
he contrived to get a letter down by the daring
of his secretary, Mr. Edward C. Gabaudan; who was
set adrift one night in a skiff ingeniously covered
with drift brush, and, thus concealed, floated undiscovered
past the enemy's guards. The small number
of his vessels prevented his extending his blockade
as far as he wished; but in closing the Red River he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
deprived the enemy of by far the best line they
possessed, and he destroyed a quantity of stores and
boats.</p>

<p>In the mean time diverse and important events
were concurring to release him from his position of
isolation. Toward the end of March General Grant,
who had for some time abandoned all expectation of
turning Vicksburg by its right flank, began the celebrated
movement down the west side of the Mississippi;
whence he crossed to the east bank at Bruinsburg,
and fought the campaign which ended by shutting
up Pemberton and his army within the lines of
the place. In furtherance of this plan, Porter himself,
with a large body of his ships, ran the batteries
at Vicksburg on the night of April 16. The fleet
then kept pace with the necessarily slow progress
of the army, encumbered with trains, through the
roads heavy with the mire of the recent overflow.
On the 29th of April the Mississippi squadron fought
a sharp engagement with the Confederate batteries
at Grand Gulf, which they could not reduce; and
the following day Grant's army crossed the river.</p>

<p>While these events were bringing the Mississippi
squadron into that part of the river which Farragut
had aimed to control, other movements were leading
to his assistance some of the lighter vessels of his
own command. After the naval action at Port Hudson,
Banks had temporarily abandoned his designs
upon that post in favor of operations west of the
Mississippi by the Bayous Teche and Atchafalaya,
the latter of which communicates with the Red River
a few miles above its mouth. This movement was
accompanied by a force of four gunboats, under the
command of Lieutenant-Commander A. P. Cooke, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
the Estrella, which captured a post on the Atchafalaya
called Butte à la Rose, on the 20th of April,
the same day that Opelousas, sixty miles from Alexandria,
was entered by the army. The latter pressed
on toward Alexandria, while the gunboats pushed
their way up the Atchafalaya. On the first of May
two of them, the Estrella and Arizona, passed into
the Red River, and soon afterward joined the Hartford.</p>

<p>Three days later Admiral Porter arrived with
several of his fleet and communicated with Farragut.
The next day, May 5th, Porter went up the Red
River and pushed rapidly toward Alexandria, which
was evacuated, its stores being removed to Shreveport,
three hundred and fifty miles farther up.</p>

<p>Farragut now felt that his personal presence
above Port Hudson was no longer necessary. The
Mississippi was ultimately to become the command
of Porter, whose vessels were especially fitted for its
waters; and that admiral was now at liberty to give
his full attention below Vicksburg. On the other
hand, his own squadron in the lower river and on the
blockade demanded a closer attention than he could
give from his isolated station. Accordingly, on the
6th of May he transferred the command to Commodore
Palmer, of the Hartford, with whom he left the
Albatross, Estrella, and Arizona to intercept communications
between the two banks of the Mississippi
below Red River; while he himself returned by one
of the bayous to New Orleans, reaching there on
the 11th.</p>

<p>Thus ended Farragut's brilliant strategic movement
against the communications of Vicksburg and
Port Hudson, and through them against the inter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>course
of the Confederacy with its great Western
storehouse, over which the two fortresses stood
guard. It was a movement which, though crippled
from the beginning by a serious disaster on the
battle-field, was conceived in accordance with the
soundest principles of the art of war. Its significance
has been obscured and lost in the great enterprise
initiated a month later by General Grant, and
solidly supported by the navy under Porter; whose
co-operation, Grant avows, was absolutely essential
to the success&mdash;nay, even to the contemplation of
such an undertaking.<a name="FNanchor_V_22" id="FNanchor_V_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_V_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a> In this combined movement,
identical in principle with that of Farragut, Porter,
in executing his part, had the current with instead of
against him. Had circumstances delayed or prevented
Grant's advance by the west bank of the Mississippi&mdash;had
he, for instance, been enabled by one
of the abortive bayou expeditions to penetrate north
of Vicksburg&mdash;Farragut's action would have been no
more sound nor bold, but its merits would have been
far more perceptible to the common eye. Re-enforcements
must have been sent him; and around his flag-ship
would have centered a force that would have
choked the life out of Vicksburg and Port Hudson.</p>

<p>Because rightly aimed, this daring campaign was
not frustrated even by the disasters of the night
action. It is distinguished from the unhappy fiasco of
the year before by all the difference between a fitting
and an unfitting time&mdash;by all that separates a clear
appreciation of facts from a confused impression of
possibilities. In 1862 Farragut was driven up the
river against his own judgment, seeing no prospect<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
of tangible or permanent results. In 1863 he went
on his own responsibility, because he saw that in the
then condition of affairs, with the armies gathering at
both ends of the line, the movement he made would
not only be successful in itself, but would materially
conduce to the attainment of the common end. It
is significant of his true military insight that neither
depreciation nor disaster shook his clear convictions
of the importance of his work. "Whether my getting
by Port Hudson was of consequence or not,"
he wrote chaffingly in reference to some slighting
comments in a Southern newspaper, "if Pollard's
stomach were as tightly pinched for food as theirs
at Port Hudson and Vicksburg have been since I
shut up Red River, he would know how to value
a good dinner and a little peace." In soberer style
he wrote to his home: "We have done our part of
the work assigned to us, and all has worked well.
<i>My last dash past Port Hudson was the best thing I ever
did</i>, except taking New Orleans. It assisted materially
in the fall of Vicksburg and Port Hudson."</p>

<p>Farragut remained but a short time in New Orleans,
and was soon again at the front; joining the
vessels of his squadron lying near, but below, Port
Hudson. After entering Alexandria on the 7th of
May, General Banks moved down with his army to
the Mississippi, which he crossed five or six miles
above Port Hudson. General Augur, of his command,
at the same time moved up from Baton Rouge,
the two divisions meeting on the 23d of May, and
immediately investing Port Hudson. An assault was
made on the 27th; but proving unsuccessful, regular
siege operations were begun. The mortar schooners
and the Essex supported them by constant bombard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>ment,
and the navy furnished and manned a battery
of four nine-inch Dahlgren guns.</p>

<p>While contributing thus conspicuously to the immediate
furtherance of the siege, the most essential
work of the navy, here as in the upper Mississippi, was
in the maintenance of the communications, which were
wholly by the river, as well as in assuring the safety
of New Orleans, then stripped of all the troops that
could be spared. The danger of two points like
Vicksburg and Port Hudson, both of such vital importance,
and both being besieged at the same time,
aroused every latent energy of the Confederacy,
and set in motion every armed man of whom it
could dispose. To divert and distract the attention
of the Union generals, to induce them to abandon
their efforts or diminish the forces at the front, no
means were so ready nor so sure as an attack upon
their communications, or a threat directed against
their base. To make these insecure, is like mining the
foundations of a building. Here the navy removed
every substantial cause of anxiety by its firm support,
and by the rapidity with which its heavy guns were
brought to sustain every point attacked. Under
such diligent guardianship the barrier of the Mississippi
remained impassable; and although a transport
might now and again be arrested and forced to
surrender, such an occasional annoyance could not
by the most uneasy general be magnified into a serious
menace to his communications. The active Confederate
general, Richard Taylor, in command of the
district west of the river, stripped all his posts to
concentrate an effort along the right bank, which, by
disturbing Banks, might make a favorable diversion
for Port Hudson; and loud talk was made of an at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>tack
upon New Orleans itself, favored by a rising
among the citizens, still heartily attached to the
Southern cause. The powerful vessels kept before
the city by Farragut effectually disposed of any
chance of such an attempt, although much anxiety
was felt by General Emory, in command of the
station, and confident expectation was plainly discernible
on the faces of the towns-people. The Confederates,
however, did for a season control the west
side of the river, appearing before Donaldsonville
and Plaquemine, where were posts of United States
troops. These were saved by the prompt appearance
of gunboats, which followed the movements of the
enemy; but the report of them brought Farragut
down in person, and elicited from him a remonstrance
to Banks for leaving upon the west bank, inadequately
sustained, heavy guns which, if they fell into the
hands of the Confederates, might convert a menace
into a serious embarrassment. A few days later, at
midnight of June 27th, the enemy attacked Donaldsonville
in force. The storming party succeeded in
entering the works, but the three gunboats which
Farragut had stationed there opened so heavy a fire
upon the supports that these broke and fled; and
those in advance, being unsustained, were made prisoners.</p>

<p>A few days later Farragut summoned his chief-of-staff,
Captain Thornton A. Jenkins, to relieve him at
Port Hudson, as he felt his own presence necessary
at New Orleans. Jenkins started up in the Monongahela,
a heavy corvette commanded by Captain
Abner Read, having in company two small transports
with needed supplies. The enemy, despite the
repulse at Donaldsonville, remained in the neighbor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>hood,
and had established a battery of field-guns a
few miles below at a bend in the river. By these
the Monongahela was attacked and pretty severely
handled for a few moments. Her captain, an officer
of distinguished courage and enterprise, was mortally
wounded, and Captain Jenkins slightly so. These
two affairs sufficiently indicate the character of the
enemy's operations on the west bank of the Mississippi
at this time. They did not in the least succeed
in shaking the grip of the Union army before Port
Hudson, nor did they entirely cease with the surrender
of the place. That they did so little harm,
with the enemy in nearly undisputed command in
the regions west of the river, was due to the navy,
whose mobility exceeded that of their troops.</p>

<p>Vicksburg surrendered on the 4th of July, 1863,
and its fall was followed by that of Port Hudson on
the 9th of the same month. Farragut then wrote to
Porter, and turned over to him the command in all the
Mississippi Valley above New Orleans. On the 1st of
August Porter himself arrived off the city in his flag-ship,
and the two admirals had an interview on the
scene of their former exploits. The same afternoon
Farragut sailed in the Hartford for the North, to
enjoy a brief respite from his labors during the enervating
autumn months of the Gulf climate. Though
now sixty-two years old, he retained an extraordinary
amount of vitality, and of energy both physical and
moral; but nevertheless at his age the anxieties and
exposure he had to undergo tell, and had drawn from
him, soon after his return from above Port Hudson,
the expressive words, "I am growing old fast, and
need rest." On the 10th of August the flag-ship anchored
in New York, after a passage of nine days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></p>

<p>The admiral remained in the North until the
first of the following year. His own ship, and her
powerful sisters, the Richmond and Brooklyn, were
in need of extensive repairs before they could be
considered again fit for winter service in the Gulf.
The Hartford was in better condition than the other
two, being uninjured below the water line, but the
severe actions through which she had passed were
proved by the scars, two hundred and forty in number,
where she had been struck by shot or shell.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

1864.</h3>


<p>By the fall of the last and most powerful of the
Confederate strongholds upon the Mississippi, and
the consequent assertion of control by the United
States Government over the whole of the great water
course, was accomplished the first and chief of the
two objects toward which Farragut was to co-operate.
After manifold efforts and failures, the
combined forces of the United States had at last
sundered the Confederacy in twain along the principal
one of those natural strategic lines which intersected
it, and which make the strength or the weakness
of States according as they are able or unable to
hold them against an enemy. Of the two fragments,
the smaller was militarily important only as a feeder
to the other. Severed from the body to which they
belonged, the seceded States west of the Mississippi
sank into insignificance; the fire that had raged
there would smoulder and die of itself, now that a
broad belt which could not be passed interposed between
it and the greater conflagration in the East.</p>

<p>It next became the task of the Union forces to
hold firmly, by adequate defensive measures, the line
they had gained; while the great mass of troops here<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>tofore
employed along the Mississippi in offensive
operations were transferred farther east, to drive yet
another column through a second natural line of
cleavage from Nashville, through Georgia, to the Gulf
or to the Atlantic seaboard. How this new work was
performed under the successive leadership of Rosecrans,
Grant, and Sherman, does not fall within the
scope of the present work. Although the light
steamers of the Mississippi squadron did good and
often important service in this distant inland region,
the river work of Farragut's heavy sea-going ships
was now over. In furtherance of the great object of
opening the Mississippi, they had left their native
element, and, braving alike a treacherous navigation
and hostile batteries, had penetrated deep into the
vitals of the Confederacy. This great achievement
wrought, they turned their prows again seaward.
The formal transfer to Admiral Porter of the command
over the whole Mississippi and its tributaries,
above New Orleans, signalized the fact that Farragut's
sphere of action was to be thenceforth on the
coast; for New Orleans, though over a hundred
miles from the mouth of a tideless river, whose
waters flow ever downward to the sea, was nevertheless
substantially a sea-coast city.</p>

<p>As the opening of the Mississippi was the more
important of the two objects embraced in Farragut's
orders, so did it also offer him the ampler field for
the display of those highest qualities of a general
officer which he abundantly possessed. The faculty
of seizing upon the really decisive points of a situation,
of correctly appreciating the conditions of the
problem before him, of discerning whether the proper
moment for action was yet distant or had already<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
arrived, and of moving with celerity and adequate
dispositions when the time did come&mdash;all these distinctive
gifts of the natural commander-in-chief had
been called into play, by the difficult questions arising
in connection with the stupendous work of breaking
the shackles by which the Confederates held the
Mississippi chained. The task that still remained
before him, the closing of the Confederate seaports
within the limits of his command, though arduous
and wearisome, did not make the same demand upon
these more intellectual qualities. The sphere was
more contracted, more isolated. It had fewer relations
to the great military operations going on elsewhere,
and, being in itself less complex, afforded less
interest to the strategist. It involved, therefore, less
of the work of the military leader which was so congenial
to his aptitudes, and more of that of the
administrator, to him naturally distasteful.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, as the complete fulfilment of his
orders necessitated the reduction of a fortified seaport,
he found in this undertaking the opportunity for
showing a degree of resolution and presence of mind
which was certainly not exceeded&mdash;perhaps not even
equaled&mdash;in his previous career. At Mobile it was
the tactician, the man of instant perception and
ready action, rather than he of clear insight and
careful planning, that is most conspicuous. On the
same occasion, with actual disaster incurred and
imminent confusion threatening his fleet, combined
with a resistance sturdier than any he had yet encountered,
the admiral's firmness and tenacity rose
equal to the highest demand ever made upon them.
In the lofty courage and stern determination which
plucked victory out of the very jaws of defeat, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
battle of Mobile Bay was to the career of Farragut
what the battle of Copenhagen was to that of
Nelson. Perhaps we may even say, borrowing the
words of an eloquent French writer upon the latter
event, the battle of Mobile will always be in the eyes
of seamen Farragut's surest claim to glory.<a name="FNanchor_W_23" id="FNanchor_W_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_W_23" class="fnanchor">[W]</a></p>

<p>Up to the time of Farragut's departure for the
North, in August, 1863, the blockade of the Gulf
sea-coast within the limits of his command, though
technically effective, had for the most part only been
enforced by the usual method of cruising or anchoring
off the entrances of the ports. Such a watch,
however, is a very imperfect substitute for the iron
yoke that is imposed by holding all the principal
harbors, the gateways for communication with the
outer world. This was clearly enough realized; and
the purpose of Farragut, as of his Government, had
been so to occupy the ports within his district. At
one time, in December, 1862, he was able to say
exultingly that he did so hold the whole coast, except
Mobile; but the disasters at Galveston and
Sabine Pass quickly intervened, and those ports remained
thenceforth in the hands of the enemy. On
the Texas coast, however, blockade-running properly
so called&mdash;the entrance, that is, of blockaded Confederate
harbors&mdash;was a small matter compared with the
flourishing contraband trade carried on through the
Mexican port Matamoras and across the Rio Grande.
When Farragut's lieutenant, Commodore Henry H.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
Bell, visited this remote and ordinarily deserted spot
in May, 1863, he counted sixty-eight sails at anchor
in the offing and a forest of smaller craft inside the
river, some of which were occupied in loading and
unloading the outside shipping; to such proportions
had grown the trade of a town which neither possessed
a harbor nor a back country capable of sustaining
such a traffic. Under proper precautions by
the parties engaged, this, though clearly hostile, was
difficult to touch; but it also became of comparatively
little importance when the Mississippi fell.</p>

<p>Not so with Mobile. As port after port was
taken, as the lines of the general blockade drew closer
and closer, the needs of the Confederacy for the approaching
death-struggle grew more and more crying,
and the practicable harbors still in their hands
became proportionately valuable and the scenes of
increasing activity. After the fall of New Orleans
and the evacuation of Pensacola, in the spring of
1862, Mobile was by far the best port on the Gulf
coast left to the Confederates. Though admitting
a less draught of water than the neighboring harbor
of Pensacola, it enjoyed the advantage over it of
excellent water communications with the interior;
two large rivers with extensive tributary systems
emptying into its bay. Thanks to this circumstance,
it had become a place of very considerable trade,
ranking next to New Orleans in the Gulf; and its
growing commerce, in turn, reacted upon the communications
by promoting the development of its
railroad system. The region of which Mobile was
the natural port did not depend for its importance
only upon agricultural products; under somewhat
favorable conditions it had developed some manu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>facturing
interests in which the Southern States were
generally very deficient, and which afterward found
active employment in the construction of the Tennessee,
the most formidable ironclad vessel built by
the Confederates.</p>

<p>For all these reasons the tenure of Mobile became
a matter of serious consequence to the enemy;
and, as Farragut had from the first foreseen, they
made active use of the respite afforded them by
the unfortunate obstinacy of the Navy Department
in refusing him permission to attack after New Orleans
fell. The enterprise then was by no means
as difficult as the passage of the Mississippi forts
just effected; and once captured, the holding of
the harbor would require only the small number of
troops necessary to garrison the powerful masonry
fort which commanded the main ship channel, supported
by a naval force much less numerous than
that required to blockade outside. The undertaking
was therefore not open to the objection of unduly
exposing the troops and ships placed in unfortified
or poorly fortified harbors, which received such a
sad illustration at Galveston; but it was dropped,
owing, first, to the preoccupation of the Government
with its expectations of immediately reducing the
Mississippi, and afterward to the fear of losing ships
which at that time could not be replaced. Hesitation
to risk their ships and to take decisive action when
seasonable opportunity offers, is the penalty paid by
nations which practise undue economy in their preparations
for war. When at last it became urgent to
capture Mobile before the powerful ironclad then
building was completed, the preparations of the defense
were so far advanced that ironclad vessels were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
needed for the attack; and before these could be, or
at least before they were, supplied, the Tennessee,
which by rapid action might have been forestalled
like the similar vessel at New Orleans, was ready for
battle. Had she been used with greater wisdom by
those who directed her movements, she might have
added very seriously to the embarrassment of the
United States admiral.</p>

<p>When Farragut, after an absence of nearly six
months, returned to his station in January, 1864, it
was with the expectation of a speedy attack upon
Mobile. On his way to New Orleans he stopped off
the bar, and on the 20th of January made a reconnaissance
with a couple of gunboats, approaching to
a little more than three miles from the forts commanding
the entrance. He then reported to the department
that he was satisfied that, if he had one
ironclad, he could destroy the whole of the enemy's
force in the bay, and then reduce the forts at leisure
with the co-operation of about five thousand troops.
"But without ironclads," he added, "we should not
be able to fight the enemy's vessels of that class with
much prospect of success, as the latter would lie on
the flats, where our ships could not get at them. By
reference to the chart you will see how small a space
there is for the ships to man&oelig;uvre. Wooden vessels
can do nothing with the ironclads, unless by getting
within one or two hundred yards, so as to ram them
or pour in a broadside." He repeats the information
given by a refugee, that the ironclad Nashville
would not be ready before March, and that the Confederate
admiral announced that when she was he
would raise the blockade. "It is depressing," he
adds, "to see how easily false reports circulate, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
in what a state of alarm the community is kept by
the most absurd rumors. If the Department could
get one or two ironclads here, it would put an end to
this state of things and restore confidence to the
people of the ports now in our possession. I feel no
apprehension about Buchanan's raising the blockade;
but, with such a force as he has in the bay, it would
be unwise to take in our wooden vessels without the
means of fighting the enemy on an equal footing."
Having made this reconnaissance, he went on to New
Orleans, arriving there January 22d.</p>

<p>It appears, therefore, that, regarded as a naval
question, Farragut considered the time had gone by
for an attempt to run the forts of Mobile Bay, and
that it would not return until some ironclads were
furnished him by the Department. The capture of
the forts he at no time expected, except by the same
means as he had looked to for the reduction of those
in the Mississippi&mdash;that is, by a combined military
and naval operation. In both cases the navy was
to plant itself across the enemy's communications,
which it could do by running the gantlet of his guns.
It then remained for the land forces either to complete
the investment and await their fall by the slow
process of famine, or to proceed with a regular siege
covered by the fleet. Without the protection of the
ships in the bay, the army would be continually
harassed by the light gunboats of the enemy, and
very possibly exposed to attack by superior force.
Without the troops, the presence of the ships inside
would be powerless to compel the surrender of the
works, or to prevent their receiving some supplies.
But in the two years that had very nearly elapsed
since Farragut, if permitted his own wish, would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
have attacked, the strengthening of the works and
the introduction of the ironclads had materially
altered the question. He was, it is true, misinformed
as to the readiness of the latter. The vessels that
were dignified by that name when he first returned
to his station, took no part in the defense, either of
the bay or, later, of the city. He was deceived,
probably, from the fact that the Confederates themselves
were deceived, with the exception of a few
who had more intimate knowledge of their real
value; and consequently the reports that were
brought off agreed in giving them a character which
they did not deserve.</p>

<p>An attack upon Mobile had been a cherished
project with General Grant after the fall of Vicksburg.
It was to that&mdash;and not to the unfortunate
Red River expedition of 1864&mdash;that he would have
devoted Banks's army in the Southwest; moving it,
of course, in concert with, so as to support and be
supported by, the other great operations which took
place that year&mdash;Sherman's advance upon Atlanta
and his own against Richmond. It was to Mobile,
and not to Savannah, that he first looked as the
point toward which Sherman would act after the
capture of Atlanta; the line from Atlanta to Mobile
would be that along which, by the control of the
intervening railroad systems, the Confederacy would
again be cleft in twain, as by the subjugation of the
Mississippi. For this reason chiefly he had, while
still only commander of the Army of the Tennessee,
and before he succeeded to the lieutenant-generalship
and the command of all the armies, strenuously opposed
the Red River expedition; which he looked
upon as an ex-centric movement, tending rather to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
keep alive the war across the Mississippi, which
would fade if left alone, and likely to result in the
troops engaged not getting back in time or in condition
to act against Mobile.</p>

<p>As Grant feared, so it happened. The expedition
being already organized and on the point of
starting when he became commander-in-chief, he
allowed it to proceed; but it ended in disaster, and
was the cause of forty thousand good troops being
unavailable for the decisive operations which began
two months later. Not until the end of July
could a force be spared even for the minor task of
reducing the Mobile forts; and until then Farragut
had to wait in order to attack to any purpose.
By the time the army in the Southwest, in the
command of which General Canby relieved Banks
on the 20th of May, was again ready to move, Sherman
had taken Atlanta, Hood had fallen upon his
communications with Chattanooga, and the famous
march to the sea had been determined. Farragut's
battle in Mobile Bay therefore did not prove to
be, as Grant had hoped, and as his passage of the
Mississippi forts had been, a step in a series of grand
military operations, by which the United States
forces should gain control of a line vital to the Confederacy,
and again divide it into two fragments. It
remained an isolated achievement, though one of
great importance, converting Mobile from a maritime
to an inland city, putting a stop to all serious
blockade-running in the Gulf, and crushing finally
the enemy's ill-founded hopes of an offensive movement
by ironclads there equipped.</p>

<p>The city of Mobile is itself some thirty miles
from the Gulf, near the head of a broad but gener<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>ally
shallow bay which bears the same name. The
principal entrance from the Gulf is between Mobile
Point&mdash;a long, narrow, sandy beach which projects
from the east side of the bay&mdash;and Dauphin Island,
one of a chain which runs parallel to the coast of
Mississippi and encloses Mississippi Sound. At the
end of Mobile Point stands Fort Morgan, the principal
defense of the bay, for the main ship channel
passes close under its guns. At the eastern end of
Dauphin Island stood a much smaller work, called
Fort Gaines. Between this and Fort Morgan the
distance is nearly three miles; but a bank of hard
sand making out from the island prevents vessels of
any considerable size approaching it nearer than two
miles. Between Dauphin Island and the mainland
there are some shoal channels, by which vessels of
very light draft can pass from Mississippi Sound into
the bay. These were not practicable for the fighting
vessels of Farragut's fleet; but a small earthwork
known as Fort Powell had been thrown up to command
the deepest of them, called Grant's Pass.</p>

<p>The sand bank off Dauphin Island extends
south as well as east, reaching between four and
five miles from the entrance. A similar shoal
stretches out to the southward from Mobile Point.
Between the two lies the main ship channel, varying
in width from seven hundred and fifty yards, three
miles outside, to two thousand, or about a sea mile,
abreast Fort Morgan. Nearly twenty-one feet can
be carried over the bar; and after passing Fort
Morgan the channel spreads, forming a hole or
pocket of irregular contour, about four miles deep
by two wide, in which the depth is from twenty to
twenty-four feet. Beyond this hole, on either side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
the bay and toward the city, the water shoals gradually
but considerably, and the heavier of Farragut's
ships could not act outside of its limits. The
Confederate ironclad Tennessee, on the contrary,
drawing but fourteen feet, had a more extensive field
of operations open to her, and, from the gradual
diminution of the soundings, was able to take her
position at a distance where the most formidable of
her opponents could neither follow her nor penetrate
her sides with their shot.</p>

<p>Between the city and the lower bay there were
extensive flats, over which not even the fourteen
feet of the Tennessee could be taken; and these in
one part, called Dog River Bar, shoaled to as little
as nine feet. To bring the Tennessee into action
for the defense of the entrance and of the lower
bay, it was necessary to carry her across these flats&mdash;an
undertaking requiring both time and mechanical
appliances, neither of which would be available
if an enemy were inside to molest the operations.
As the Tennessee was distinctly the most
formidable element in the dangers Farragut had
to encounter, and as the character of the soundings
gave her a field of action peculiarly suited to
utilize her especial powers, which consisted in the
strength of her sides and the long range of her
heavy rifled guns, it was particularly desirable to
anticipate her crossing the upper bar by the fleet
itself crossing the lower. That done, the Tennessee
was reduced to impotence. It was not done, for
two reasons. First, the Navy Department did not
send the ironclads which Farragut demanded; and
second, the army in the Southwest, having wasted
its strength in a divergent operation, was unable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
to supply the force necessary to reduce Fort Morgan.
That the delay was not productive of more
serious consequences was due to the impatience or
recklessness of the Confederate admiral, and to the
energy with which Farragut seized the opportunity
afforded by his mistake.</p>

<p>Six months passed before the moment for decisive
action arrived. Though devoid of military
interest, they were far from being months of idleness
or enjoyment. The administrative duties of so large
a command drew heavily upon the time and energies
of the admiral, and, as has been said, they were not
congenial to him. When the Tennessee crossed Dog
River Bar, which she did on the 18th of May, Farragut
felt that he must be on the spot, in case she
attempted to execute her threat of coming out to
break up the blockade; but up to that time he was
moving actively from point to point of his command,
between New Orleans on the one side, and Pensacola,
now become his principal base, on the other. From
time to time he was off Mobile, and for more than
two months preceding the battle of the Bay he lay
off the port in all the dreary monotony of blockade
service. The clerical labor attaching to the large
force and numerous interests entrusted to him was
immense. Every mail brought him, of course, numerous
communications from the Department. "I
received your letter last evening," he writes to a
member of his family, "but at the same time received
so many from the Department that my eyes
were used up before I came to yours, so that mine
to you will be short and badly written." A very
large part of this correspondence consisted of letters
from United States consuls abroad, forwarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
through the State Department, giving particulars
of vessels fitting or loading for the Confederacy or
to break the blockade. "Nearly all my clerical
force is broken down," he writes on another occasion.
"The fact is, I never saw so much writing;
and yet Drayton, who does as much as any of
them, says it is all necessary. So I tell them to go
on. I do not mind signing my name. Although
I write all my own letters, some one has to copy
them. My fleet is so large now that it keeps us all
at work the whole time."</p>

<p>But while he spoke thus lightly of his own share
in these labors, the confinement, the necessary attention
to and study of larger details, even while he
intrusted the minor to others, and the unavoidable
anxieties of a man who had so many important irons
in the fire, and at the same time was approaching his
sixty-fourth year, told upon him. To this he bore
witness when, after the capture of the Mobile forts,
the Department desired him to take command of the
North Atlantic fleet, with a view to the reduction of
Wilmington, North Carolina. "They must think I
am made of iron," he wrote home. "I wrote the
Secretary a long letter, telling him that my health
was not such as to justify my going to a new station
to commence new organizations; that I must have
rest for my mind and exercise for my body; that I
had been down here within two months of five years,
out of six, and recently six months on constant blockade
off this port, <i>and my mind on the stretch all the time</i>;
and now to commence a blockade again on the Atlantic
coast! Why, even the routine of duty for a
fleet of eighty sail of vessels works us all to death;
and but that I have the most industrious fleet-captain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
and secretary, it would never be half done. It is difficult
to keep things straight." "I know," he writes
on another occasion, "that few men could have gone
through what I have in the last three years, and no
one ever will know except yourself perhaps....
What the fight was to my poor brains, neither you
nor any one else will ever be able to comprehend.
Six months constantly watching day and night for
an enemy; to know him to be as brave, as skilful,
and as determined as myself; who was pledged to
his Government and the South to drive me away and
raise the blockade, and free the Mississippi from our
rule. While I was equally pledged to my Government
that I would capture or destroy the rebel."</p>

<p>Besides his labors and the official anxieties due to
his individual command, he again, as in 1862, felt
deeply the misfortunes with which the general campaign
of 1864 opened, and especially in the Southwest.
There was continually present to the minds
of the leaders of the United States forces during the
war the apprehension that the constancy of the
people might fail; that doubtful issues might lead
to a depression that would cause the abandonment
of the contest, in which success was nevertheless assured
to perseverance and vigor. Grant's memoirs
bear continual testimony to the statesmanlike regard
he had, in planning his greater military operations, to
this important factor in the war, the vacillation
under uncertainty of that popular support upon
which success depended. The temperament of Farragut
reflected readily the ups and downs of the
struggle, and was saddened by the weaknesses and
inconsistencies of his own side, which he keenly appreciated.
"I am <i>depressed</i>," he writes, "by the bad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
news from every direction. The enemy seem to be
bending their whole soul and body to the war and
whipping us in every direction. What a disgrace
that, with their slender means, they should, after
three years, contend with us from one end of the
country to the other!... <i>I get right sick</i>, every now
and then, at the bad news." "The victory of the
Kearsarge over the Alabama," on a more auspicious
occasion, "raised me up. I would sooner have
fought that fight than any ever fought on the
ocean"; and his exultation was the greater that the
first lieutenant of the Kearsarge had been with him
in the same capacity when the Hartford passed the
Mississippi forts.</p>

<p>But, while thus sensitive to the vicissitudes of his
country's fortunes, he did not readily entertain the
thought of being himself defeated. "As to being
prepared for defeat," he wrote before New Orleans,
"I certainly am not. Any man who is prepared for
defeat would be half defeated before he commenced.
I hope for success; shall do all in my power to secure
it, and trust to God for the rest." And again:
"The officers say I don't believe anything. I certainly
believe very little that comes in the shape of
reports. They keep everybody stirred up. I mean
to be whipped or to whip my enemy, and not to be
scared to death." "I hope for the best results," he
wrote a week before forcing the passage into Mobile
Bay, "as I am always hopeful; put my shoulder to
the wheel with my best judgment, and trust to God
for the rest"; or, in more homely language: "Everything
has a weak spot, and the first thing I try to
do is to find out where it is, and pitch into it with
the biggest shell or shot that I have, and repeat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
the dose until it operates." "The Confederates at
Fort Morgan are making great preparations to receive
us. That concerns me but little"&mdash;words used
not in a spirit of mere light-heartedness, but because
it was a condition he had from the first accepted,
and over which he hoped to triumph; for he continues,
"I know they will do all in their power to
destroy us, and we will reciprocate the compliment.
I hope to give them a fair fight if once I get inside.
I expect nothing from them but that they will try to
blow me up if they can."</p>

<p>Amid such cares and in such a spirit were spent
the six months of monotonous outside blockade preceding
the great victory that crowned his active
career. The only relief to its weariness was a
bombardment of Fort Powell, undertaken by the
light-draft steamers of the squadron from Mississippi
Sound in February, to create a diversion in favor of
Sherman's raid from Vicksburg upon Meridian, which
was then in progress. The boats could not get
nearer to the work than four thousand yards, and
even then were aground; so that no very serious
effect was produced. A greater and more painful
excitement was aroused by the misfortunes of the
Red River expedition in April and May. Begun on
unsound military principles, but designed politically
to assert against French intrigues the claim of the
United States to Texas, that ill-omened enterprise
culminated in a retreat which well-nigh involved the
Mississippi squadron in an overwhelming disaster.
The Red River was unusually low for the season,
and falling instead of rising. There was not, when
the army retired, water enough to enable the gun-boats
which had ascended the river to repass the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
rapids at Alexandria. The army could delay but
for a limited time, at the end of which, if the boats
had not passed, they must be left to their fate. Farragut,
who was in New Orleans when the news arrived,
wrote bitterly about the blunders made, and
was sorely distressed for the issue to the navy. "I
have no spirit to write," he says. "I have had such
long letters from Porter and Banks, and find things
so bad with them that I don't know how to help
them. I am afraid Porter, with all his energy, will
lose some of his finest vessels. I have just sent him
some boats to help him." The boats, however, were
saved by the skill and energy of Colonel Joseph Bailey,
the chief-of-engineers in Franklin's corps of Banks's
army; by whom was thrown across the river a dam,
which raised the water on the shoals sufficiently for
the boats to cross.</p>

<p>A more pleasant incident occurred to vary the
sameness of the blockade days, in the presentation
to the admiral, by the Union League Club of New
York, of a very handsome sword, with scabbard of
massive gold and silver, the hilt set in brilliants.
The gift was accompanied by a letter expressive of
the givers' appreciation of the brilliant services rendered
to the nation, and was a grateful reminder to
Farragut, then watching before Mobile for his last
grapple with the enemy in his front, that his fellow-countrymen
in their homes were not wanting in
recognition of the dangers he had incurred, nor of
those he was still facing on their behalf.</p>

<p>The time was now close at hand when the weary
and anxious waiting, which the admiral afterward so
feelingly described, was to be exchanged for the
more vigorous action he had so long desired. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
co-operation of a division from Canby's army was
assured toward the end of July; and at the same
time the long-promised, long-delayed monitor ironclads
began to arrive. As the want of these and the
presence of the enemy's ironclads had been the reasons
which, in Farragut's opinion, had made necessary
the postponement of the purely naval part of
the combined operation, a short description of the
vessels which formed so potent an element in his calculations
will not be out of place.</p>

<p>The idea of the monitor type of ironclads, which
was then the prevalent one in the United States
Navy, was brought by John Ericsson from his home
in Sweden, where it had been suggested to him by
the sight of the rafts with a house upon them crossing
the waters with which he was familiar. In its
conception, the monitor was simply a round fort,
heavily plated with iron, resting upon a raft nearly
flush with the water, and provided with the motive
power of steam. The forts, or turrets, as they are
commonly called, might be one or more in number;
and each carried usually two heavy guns, standing
side by side and pointing in exactly the same direction,
so that if discharged together the projectiles
would follow parallel courses. Within the turret the
guns could be turned neither to the right nor to the
left; if such a change of aim were wished, the turret
itself was revolved by steam machinery provided for
the purpose. When loading, the port through which
the gun was fired was turned away from the enemy;
so that if a shot happened to strike at that time it
fell on the solid armor. Above the gun-turret there
was a second of much smaller diameter, which did
not revolve. It was also heavily plated and designed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
to shelter the commanding officer and those charged
with the steering of the ship. So much inconvenience
was, however, experienced from smoke and from
concussion when these steering turrets were struck,
and their dimensions were so contracted, that many
captains preferred to remain outside, where they
could see better, their orders being transmitted to
the helmsmen through the sight-holes pierced in the
armor. Of these ironclads, four accompanied Farragut
in his attack upon Mobile Bay. Two, the Tecumseh
and Manhattan, came from the Atlantic
coast, and were sea-going monitors. They had each
but one turret, in which they carried two fifteen-inch
guns, the heaviest then in use afloat. The other two
were river monitors, built at St. Louis for service in
the Mississippi. They were consequently of light
draught, so much so that to obtain the necessary motive
power they each had four screw propellers of
small diameter, and they carried four eleven-inch
guns in two turrets. Their names were the Winnebago
and the Chickasaw. The armor of the two
single-turreted monitors was ten inches thick, and
that of the river monitors eight and a half inches.</p>

<p>The Tennessee, to which these were to be opposed,
was a vessel of different type, and one to
which the few ironclads built by the Confederates
for the most part conformed&mdash;called commonly the
broadside ironclad, because the guns, like those of
ships-of-war generally, were disposed chiefly along
the sides. Her hull was built at Selma, on the Alabama
River, and thence towed to Mobile to be plated;
it being desirable to take her down the river while
as light as possible. She was two hundred and nine
feet long and forty-eight feet wide, drawing, as has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
been said, fourteen feet when loaded. Upon her
deck, midway between the bow and the stern, was a
house seventy-nine feet long, whose sides and ends
sloped at an angle of thirty-four degrees and were
covered with iron plating, six inches thick on the
forward end and five inches thick on the other end
and the sides. With the inclination given, a cannon
ball striking would be likely to be turned upward by
the iron surface, instead of penetrating. The sloping
sides of the house were carried down beyond the
point where they met those of the vessel, until two
feet below the water. There they turned and struck
in at the same angle toward the hull, which they
again met six or seven feet under water. Thus was
formed all round the ship a knuckle, which, being
filled-in solid and covered with iron, was a very perfect
protection against any but the most powerful
ram. The Tennessee herself was fitted with a beak
and intended to ram, but, owing to the slender resources
of the Confederacy, her engines were too
weak to be effective for that purpose. She could
only steam six knots. Her battery, however, was
well selected and powerful. She carried on each
side two six-inch rifles, and at each end one seven-inch
rifle&mdash;six guns in all. There were, besides the
Tennessee, three wooden gunboats, and Farragut
was informed that there were also four ironclads;
but this, as regards the lower bay at least, was a mistake.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this account, and from the
description before given of Mobile Bay, that the advantages
of the Tennessee were her great protective
strength, a draught which enabled her to choose her
own position relatively to the heaviest of the enemy's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
ships, and the superior range and penetrative power
of her guns, being rifles; for while there were cannon
of this type in the United States fleet, the great
majority of them were smooth bores. The ironclads
opposed to her had only smooth-bore guns, incapable
of penetrating her side, and therefore only able to
reduce her by a continued pounding, which might
shake her frame to pieces. The chief defects of the
Tennessee as a harbor-defense ship, for which she
was mainly intended, were her very inferior speed,
and the fact that, by an oversight, her steering chains
were left exposed to the enemy's shot. This combination
of strong and weak points constituted her
tactical qualities, which should have determined the
use made of her in the impending battle.</p>

<p>Although the ironclads were, as Farragut esteemed
them, the controlling factors in the defense
and attack, the Tennessee was by no means the only
very formidable obstacle in the way of his success.
Except the ironclads, the fleet he carried into Mobile
Bay was not substantially stronger than that with
which he fought his way up the Mississippi; but
since that time the enemy had done much to
strengthen the works which he now had to encounter.
The number of heavy guns in Fort Morgan
bearing upon the channel was thirty-eight. In Fort
Jackson, excluding the obsolete caliber of twenty-four
pounders, there were twenty-seven, and in St.
Philip twenty-one&mdash;total, forty-eight; but in caliber
and efficiency those of Morgan were distinctly superior
to those of the river forts, and it may be considered
an advantage that the power was here concentrated
in a single work under a single hand. The
gunners of Fort Morgan, moreover, had not been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
exposed to the exhausting harassment of a most
efficient bombardment, extending over the six days
prior to the final demand upon their energies. They
came fresh to their work, and suffered during its continuance
from no distraction except that caused by
the fire of the fleet itself. While, therefore, Fort
Gaines could not be considered to support Morgan
by any deterrent or injurious influence upon the
United States fleet, the latter work was by itself superior
in offensive power to the two Mississippi
forts.</p>

<p>To the general defense the Confederates had
here brought two other factors, one of a most important
and as yet unknown power. As the sand
bank extending eastward from Dauphin Island was
to some extent passable by light gunboats, a line of
piles was driven in the direction of Fort Morgan
nearly to the edge of the channel. Where the piles
stopped a triple line of torpedoes began, following
the same general course, and ending only at a hundred
yards from Fort Morgan, where a narrow
opening was left for the passage of friendly vessels&mdash;blockade
runners and others. Had the electrical
appliances of the Confederacy been at that time more
highly developed, this narrow gap would doubtless
also have been filled with mines, whose explosion depended
upon operators ashore. As it was, the torpedo
system employed at Mobile, with some few possible
exceptions, was solely mechanical; the explosion
depended upon contact by the passing vessel with
the mine. To insure this, the line was triple; those
in the second and third rows not being in the alignment
of the first, but so placed as to fill the interstices
and make almost impracticable the avoid<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>ance
of all three torpedoes belonging to the same
group.</p>

<p>These arrangements were sufficiently well known
to Farragut through information brought by refugees
or deserters. They&mdash;the power of the works,
the disposition of the torpedoes, the Tennessee and
her companions&mdash;constituted the elements of the
problem which he had to solve to get his fleet safely
past the obstacles into the bay. Although not disposed
to lay as much stress as others upon the torpedoes,
which were then but an imperfectly developed
weapon, prudence dictated to him the necessity
of passing between them and the fort; and this was
fortunately in accordance with the sound policy
which dictates that wooden vessels engaging permanent
works, less liable than themselves to penetration,
should get as close as possible to the enemy,
whose fire they may then beat down by the rapidity
of their own. There were certain black buoys floating
across the channel, between the piles and Fort
Morgan, and it was understood that these marked
the position of the torpedoes. The admiral's flag-lieutenant,
Lieutenant (now Captain) John C. Watson,
had examined these buoys in several nightly
reconnaissances; but, although he had not been able
to discover any of the mines, the assurances of their
existence could not be disregarded. His examination
doubtless had some effect upon the admiral's
instant determination, in the unforeseen emergency
that arose during the action, to pass over the spot
where the hidden dangers were said to lie; but in the
dispositions for battle the order was given for the
fleet to pass eastward of the easternmost buoy, where
no torpedoes would be found.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span></p>

<p>The closeness of this approach, however, and the
fact that the line of the channel led in at right angles
to the entrance, had the disadvantage of obstructing
the fire of the broadside wooden vessels, in which the
offensive strength of the fleet, outside the monitors,
consisted. The guns of those ships, being disposed
along the sides, were for the most part able to bear
only upon an enemy abreast of them, with a small
additional angle of train toward ahead or astern. It
was not, therefore, until nearly up with the fort that
these numerous cannon would come into play, and
exercise that preponderating effect which had driven
off the gunners at Forts St. Philip and Jackson.
This inconvenience results from the construction of
such ships, and can only be overcome by a movement
of the helm causing the ship to diverge from
her course; a resort which led a witty Frenchman to
say that a ship-of-war so situated is like a shark,
that can only bite by turning on its back. The
remedy, however applicable under certain circumstances
and in the case of a single ship, causes delay,
and therefore is worse than the evil for a fleet
advancing to the attack of forts, where the object
must be to close as rapidly as possible. There are,
however, on board such vessels a few guns, mounted
forward and called chase guns, which, from the
rounding of the bows, bear sooner than the others
upon the enemy toward whom they are moving. To
support these and concentrate from the earliest moment
as effective a fire as possible upon the works,
Farragut brought his ironclads inside of the wooden
vessels, and abreast the four leaders of that column.
The heavy guns of the monitors could fire all around
the horizon, from right ahead to right astern; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the disposition had the additional great advantage
that, in the critical passage inside the torpedo buoys,
these all-important vessels would be on the safer
side, the wooden ships interposing between them and
the sunken dangers, which threatened an injury far
more instantaneous and vital than any to be feared
from the enemy's shot and shell.</p>

<p>The position of the ironclads being determined
by these considerations, the arrangement of the
wooden ships for the attack conformed to the admiral's
principle, that the greatest security was to be
found in concentrating upon the enemy the heaviest
fire attainable from his own guns. As at Port Hudson,
a large proportion of the fourteen vessels he
purposed to take in with him were of the gunboat
class, or a little above it. Resort was accordingly
again had to the double column adopted there; the
seven ships that had the most powerful batteries
forming the right column to engage Fort Morgan.
The lighter ones were distributed in the other column,
and lashed each to one of the heavier ships, in
an order probably designed, though it is not expressly
so stated, to make the combined steam power
of the several pairs as nearly equal as possible.
Among the gunboats there were three that had side-wheel
engines, the machinery of which is necessarily
more above water, and so more exposed than that of
a screw&mdash;a condition which, although their batteries
were powerful for their tonnage, emphasized the necessity
of sheltering them behind other ships during
the furious few minutes of passing under the guns of
the fort.</p>

<p>The sum of these various considerations thus
resulted in the fleet advancing into action in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
column of pairs, in which the heaviest ships led in
the fighting column. To this the admiral was probably
induced by the reflection that the first broadsides
are half the battle, and the freshest attack of
the enemy should be met by the most vigorous resistance
on his own part; but it is open to doubt
whether one of these powerful vessels would not
have been better placed in the rear. Upon a resolute
enemy, the effect of each ship is simply to drive
him to cover while she passes, to resume his activity
when relieved from the pressure of her fire. The
case is not strictly similar to the advance of a column
of troops upon a fortified position, where the head
does the most of the fighting, and the rear mainly
contributes inertia to the movement of the mass. It
is at least open to argument that a fire progressively
diminishing from van to rear is not, for the passage
of permanent works, a disposition as good as a
weight of battery somewhat more equally distributed,
with, however, a decided preponderance in the van.
The last of the ships in this column received a shot
in the boiler, which entirely disabled her&mdash;an accident
that may have been purely fortuitous, and to
which any one of her predecessors was in a degree
liable, but also possibly due to the greater activity
of the enemy when no longer scourged by the more
powerful batteries which preceded. She was saved
from the more serious results of this disaster, and
the squadron spared the necessity of rallying to her
support, by the other admirable precautions dictated
by Farragut's forethought.</p>

<p>Subjected thus to analysis, there seems much to
praise and very little to criticise in the tactical dispositions
made by the admiral on this momentous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
occasion. But the tactical dispositions, though most
important, are not the only considerations; it is the
part of the commander-in-chief to take advantage of
any other circumstances that may make in his
favor. Until the forts were passed the character of
the bottom left Farragut no choice as to the direction
of his attack. There was but one road to
take, and the only other question was the order in
which to arrange his ships. But there were two
conditions not entirely within his control, yet sure
to occur in time, which he considered too advantageous
to be overlooked. He wanted a flood tide,
which would help a crippled vessel past the works;
and also a west wind, which would blow the smoke
from the scene of battle and upon Fort Morgan,
thereby giving to the pilots, upon whom so much depended,
and to the gunners of the ships, the advantage
of clearer sight. The time of the tide, in most
quarters a matter of simple calculation, is in the
Gulf often affected by the wind. The wind, on the
other hand, in the summer months, blows from the
south during the early morning, and then works
round to the westward; so that the chances were in
favor of his obtaining his wishes.</p>

<p>The dispositions taken by the Confederates to
meet the assault which they saw to be impending were
more simple; they having but a small mobile force,
and their fortifications being tied to their places. A
seaport liable to attack is a battle-field, in utilizing
whose natural features, so as to present the strongest
tactical combination against entrance or subjection
by an enemy, the skill of the engineer is shown;
but, unlike battle-fields in general, much time and
study is allowed to develop his plans. In the case<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of Mobile Bay, the narrow and direct character of
the approach by the main ship channel left little opportunity
for skill to display itself. To place at the
end of Mobile Point the heaviest fort, enfilading the
channel, and to confine the latter to the narrowest
bed, compelling the assailant into the most unfavorable
route, were measures too obvious to escape the
most incapable. To obtain the utmost advantage
from this approach of the enemy, the little naval
force was advanced from Mobile Point, so as to
stretch at right angles across the channel just within
the torpedo line. There, without being incommoded
by the fire of the fort, or in any way embarrassing it,
they secured a clear sweep for their guns, raking
their opponents; who, being for the time unable to
deviate from their course, could not reply to this
galling attack. By gradually retiring, the Confederate
gunboats could retain this superiority during
the advance of their foes, until the latter reached
the wide hole within, where there was room to man&oelig;uvre.
This position and the subsequent course of
action described comprise the tactical management
of the Southern vessels during the engagement. It
was well devised, and made probably the best use of
the advantages of the ground possible to so inferior
a force. The Tennessee took position with them,
but her after action was different.</p>

<p>As the day of the last and, with the exception of
the Essex fight of his boyhood, the most desperate
battle of his life drew near, a certain solemnity&mdash;one
might almost say depression&mdash;is perceptible in the
home letters of the admiral. Had the action proved
fatal to him it could scarcely have failed to attract
the attention which is similarly arrested by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
chastened tone of Nelson's life and writing immediately
before Trafalgar; and although there is certainly
none of that outspoken foreboding which
marked the last day of the English hero, Farragut's
written words are in such apparent contrast to the
usual buoyant, confident temper of the man, that
they would readily have been construed into one of
those presentiments with which military annals
abound. "With such a mother," he writes to his son
a week before the battle, "you could not fail to have
proper sentiments of religion and virtue. I feel that
I have done my duty by you both, as far as the
weakness of my nature would allow. I have been
devoted to you both, and when it pleases God to
take me hence I shall feel that I have done my
duty. I am not conscious of ever having wronged
any one, and have tried to do as much good as I
could. Take care of your mother if I should go, and
may God bless and preserve you both!" The day
before the action he wrote the following letter to his
wife, which, as his son remarks in his Life of the
admiral, shows that he appreciated the desperate
work before him:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p style="text-align: right">
"<span class="smcap">Flag-ship Hartford,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">Off Mobile</span>, <i>August 4, 1864</i>.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dearest Wife</span>: I write and leave this letter
for you. I am going into Mobile in the morning, if
God is my leader, as I hope he is, and in him I place
my trust. If he thinks it is the proper place for me
to die, I am ready to submit to his will in that as in
all other things. My great mortification is that my
vessels, the ironclads, were not ready to have gone
in yesterday. The army landed last night, and are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
in full view of us this morning, and the Tecumseh
has not yet arrived from Pensacola.</p>

<p>"God bless and preserve you, my darling, and
my dear boy, if anything should happen to me; and
may his blessings also rest upon your dear mother,
and all your sisters and their children.</p>

<p>"Your devoted and affectionate husband, who
never for one moment forgot his love, duty, or
fidelity to you, his devoted and best of wives,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">"<span class="smcap">D. G. Farragut</span>."<br /></p></div>

<p>A more touching and gratifying testimony of unwavering
attachment, after more than twenty years
of marriage, no wife could desire. It was an attachment
also not merely professed in words, but evidenced
by the whole course of his life and conduct.
Infidelity or neglect of a wife was, in truth, in the
estimation of Admiral Farragut, one of the most
serious of blots upon a man's character, drawing out
always his bitterest condemnation.</p>

<p>A pleasing glimpse is at this same period afforded
of his relations to the surviving members of his
father's family, who still remained in or near New
Orleans, and from whom by the conditions of his profession
he had been separated since his childhood.
"My dear sister," he writes, "has sent me a Holy
Virgin like the one Rose gave me. She said it was
blessed by the archbishop, who said I was good to
the priests. I only tell you this," adds the admiral
dryly, "to show you that they did not succeed in
impressing the bishop with the idea that I had
robbed the church at Point Coupée." This is not
the only mention of his sister during this time, and
it is evident that two years' occupation of New Or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>leans
by the Union forces had done much to mollify
public sentiment; for immediately after the surrender
he had written home, "It is a strange thought
that I am here among my relatives, and yet not one
has dared to say 'I am happy to see you.'"</p>

<p>On the 8th of July General Canby, accompanied
by General Granger, who was to have immediate
charge of the land operations against the Mobile
forts, had called upon the admiral to make the preliminary
arrangements. Somewhat later Canby sent
word that he could not spare men enough to invest
both Gaines and Morgan at the same time; and at
Farragut's suggestion it was then decided to land
first upon Dauphin Island, he undertaking to send a
gunboat to cover the movement. Granger visited
him again on the 1st of August, and as the admiral
then had reason to expect the last of his monitors by
the 4th, that day was fixed for the attack and landing.
Granger was up to time, and his troops were
put ashore on the evening of the 3d; but the Tecumseh
had not arrived from Pensacola. The other
three had been on hand since the 1st, anchored
under the shelter of Sand Island, three miles from
Fort Morgan.</p>

<p>To Farragut's great mortification he was unable
to carry out his part of the programme; but on the
evening of the 4th the Tecumseh arrived, together
with the Richmond, which had been for a few days
at Pensacola preparing for the fight. "I regret to
have detained you, admiral," said Craven, the commander
of the monitor, "but had it not been for
Captain Jenkins (of the Richmond), God knows
when I should have been here. When your order
came I had not received an ounce of coal." In his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
report of the battle, Farragut warmly acknowledged
the zeal and energy of Jenkins, to which he owed
the seasonable arrival of this important re-enforcement.
"He takes," he said, "as much interest in the
fleet now as formerly when he was my chief-of-staff.
He is also commanding officer of the second division
of my squadron, and as such has shown ability and
the most untiring zeal.... I feel I should not be
doing my duty did I not call the attention of the
Department to an officer who has performed all his
various duties with so much zeal and fidelity." Farragut
has been charged with failure to notice adequately
the services of those under him; but the
foregoing words, which are not by any means unparalleled
in his dispatches, show that he could
praise cordially when he saw fitting occasion.</p>

<p>The night of August 4th was quiet, the sea
smooth, with a light air just rippling the surface of
the water. At sundown it had been raining hard,
but toward midnight cleared off, the weather becoming
hot and calm. Later on a light air again
sprang up from the southwest. The admiral was not
well, and slept restlessly. About three in the morning
he called his servant and sent him to find out
how the wind was. Learning that it was from the
quarter he wished, he said, "Then we will go in in
the morning." Between four and five the lighter vessels
got under way and went alongside those to
which they were to be lashed. When daybreak was
reported Farragut was already at breakfast with the
captain of the Hartford, Percival Drayton, and the
fleet-surgeon, Dr. James C. Palmer, who had left his
usual post at the hospital in Pensacola to superintend
the care of those wounded in the approaching<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
battle. It was then about half-past five; the couples
were all formed, and the admiral, still sipping his
tea, said quietly, "Well, Drayton, we might as well
get under way." The signal was made and at once
acknowledged by the vessels, which had all been
awaiting it, and the seamen began to heave round
on the cables. The taking their assigned positions
in the column by the different pairs consumed some
time, during which the flag-ship crossed the bar, at
ten minutes past six. At half-past six the column of
wooden vessels was formed, and the monitors were
standing down from Sand Island into their stations,
in gaining which some little further delay was
caused. At this time all the ships hoisted the United
States flag, not only at the peak where it commonly
flies, but at every mast-head as well.</p>

<p>It had been the intention of the admiral to lead
the column of wooden vessels with his own ship; but
at the earnest request of many officers, who thought
the fleet should not incur the greater risk consequent
upon having its commander in so exposed a position,
he reluctantly consented to waive his purpose, and
the Brooklyn was appointed to this post of honor.
To this selection contributed also the fact that the
Brooklyn had more than the usual number of chase
guns, the advantage of which has been explained,
and also an arrangement for picking up torpedoes.
Bitterly afterward did Farragut regret his yielding
on this occasion. "I believe this to be an error,"
he wrote in his official report of the battle; "for,
apart from the fact that exposure is one of the
penalties of rank in the navy, it will <i>always</i> be the
aim of the enemy to destroy the flag-ship, and, as
will appear in the sequel, such attempt was very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
persistently made." "The fact is," he said in one
of his letters home, "had I been the obstinate man
you sometimes think me, I would have led in the
fleet and saved the Tecumseh"&mdash;meaning, doubtless,
that, by interposing between that important vessel
and the buoy which marked the torpedo line, he
would have prevented the error which caused her
loss. Some notes upon the action found afterward
among his papers contain the same opinion, more
fully and deliberately expressed. "Allowing the
Brooklyn to go ahead was a great error. It lost
not only the Tecumseh, but many valuable lives, by
keeping us under the fire of the forts for thirty minutes;
whereas, had I led, as I intended to do, I
would have gone inside the buoys, and all would
have followed me." The Hartford took the second
place in the column, having secured on her port or
off side the side-wheel gunboat Metacomet, Lieutenant-Commander
James E. Jouett.</p>

<p>While the monitors were taking their stations,
the Tecumseh, which led their column, fired two
shots at the fort. At five minutes before seven, the
order of battle now being fully formed, the fleet
went ahead. Ten minutes later Fort Morgan opened
fire upon the Brooklyn, which at once replied with
her bow guns, followed very soon by those of the
fighting column of wooden ships; a brisk cannonade
ensuing between them, the monitors, and the fort. In
order to see more clearly, and at the same time to
have immediately by him the persons upon whom he
most depended for governing the motions of the
ship, Farragut had taken his position in the port
main-rigging. Here he had near him Captain Jouett,
standing on the wheel-house of the Metacomet, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
also the pilot, who, as at Port Hudson, had been stationed
aloft, on this occasion in the maintop, so as
to see well over the smoke. As this increased and
rose higher, Farragut went up step by step until he
was close under the maintop. Here, without losing
touch with Jouett, he was very near the pilot, had
the whole scene of battle spread out under his eyes,
and at the same time, by bracing himself against the
futtock shrouds, was able to use his spy-glass more
freely. Captain Drayton, however, being alarmed
lest he might be thrown to the deck, directed a seaman
to carry a lashing aloft and secure him to the
rigging, which the admiral, after a moment's remonstrance,
permitted. By such a simple and natural
train of causes was Farragut brought to and secured
in a position which he, like any other commander-in-chief,
had sought merely in order better to see the
operations he had to direct; but popular fancy was
caught by the circumstance, and to his amusement
he found that an admiral lashed to the rigging was
invested with a significance equivalent to that of
colors nailed to the mast. "The illustrated papers
are very amusing," he wrote home. "Leslie has me
lashed up to the mast like a culprit, and says, 'It is
the way officers will hereafter go into battle, etc.'
You understand, I was only standing in the rigging
with a rope, that dear boy Watson had brought me
up," (this was later in the action, when the admiral
had shifted his position), "saying that if I would stand
there I had better secure myself against falling; and
I thanked him for his consideration, and took a turn
around and over the shrouds and around my body
for fear of being wounded, as shots were flying
rather thickly."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly after the monitors and the bow guns of
the fleet began firing, the enemy's gunboats and the
Tennessee moved out from behind Morgan and took
their position enfilading the channel. Twenty minutes
later, through the advance of the column, the
broadsides of the leading ships began to bear upon
the fort; and as these heavy batteries vomited
their iron rain the fire of the defense visibly
slackened. Amid the scene of uproar and slaughter,
in which the petty Confederate flotilla, thanks to its
position of vantage, was playing a deadly part quite
out of proportion to its actual strength, the Tecumseh
alone was silent. After the first two shots fired
by her, which were rather the signal of warning than
the opening of the battle, she had loaded her two
guns with steel shot, backed by the heaviest charge
of powder allowed, and, thus prepared, reserved her
fire for the Tennessee alone. "I believe," wrote
Farragut in a private letter, "that the Tecumseh
would have gone up and grappled with and captured
the Tennessee. Craven's heart was bent upon it."</p>

<p>The two columns, of ironclads and of wooden
vessels lashed together in pairs, were now approaching
the line of torpedoes and the narrow entrance
through which lay the path of safety; and the broadsides
of the heavy sloops which led&mdash;the Brooklyn,
the Hartford, the Richmond&mdash;supported by the less
numerous but still powerful batteries following, and
by the guns of the turreted ironclads, overbore the
fire of the works. All promised fairly, provided the
leaders of the two columns pushed rapidly and unhesitatingly
in the direction assigned them. But
almost at the same moment doubt seized them both,
and led to a double disaster. As Craven, leading the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
monitor column, and then about three hundred yards
in advance of the Brooklyn, drew up to the buoy, to
the eastward of which he had been directed to go,
he saw it so nearly in line with the point beyond
that he could not believe it possible to pass. "It is
impossible that the admiral means us to go inside
that buoy," he said to the pilot; "I can not turn my
ship." Just then the Tennessee moved a little ahead,
to the westward; and Craven, under the double impulse
of his doubt and of his fear lest the hostile
ironclad should escape him, changed his course to
the left and pushed straight for her, the Tecumseh
heading to pass the buoy on the wrong side.</p>

<p>The movement thus indicated, if followed by the
succeeding monitors, would throw that column across
the path of the wooden ships if the latter endeavored
to obey their orders to pass east of the buoy. At the
same moment there were seen from the Brooklyn, in
the water ahead, certain objects which were taken
to be buoys for torpedoes. The ship was at once
stopped and backed, coming down upon the Hartford,
her next astern, which also stopped, but did
not reverse her engines. The Richmond followed
the Hartford's movements, and the two ships drifted
up with the young flood tide, but with their heads
still pointed in the right direction, toward the Brooklyn;
the stern of the latter vessel, as she backed,
coming up into the wind so that her bows turned
toward the fort. Fortunately, the rear ships were
some little distance off; but Farragut, ignorant of
the cause of the Brooklyn's action, saw his line of
battle doubling up and threatened with an almost inextricable
confusion, in the most difficult and exposed
part of the passage, under a cross-fire from the fort<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
and the enemy's vessels. Immediately upon this
frightful perplexity succeeded the great disaster of
the day. Craven, pursuing his course across the suspected
line of danger, had reached within two hundred
yards of the Tennessee, and the crews of both
vessels were waiting with tense nerves for the expected
collision, when a torpedo exploded under the
Tecumseh, then distant a little over five hundred
yards from the Hartford. From his elevated post of
observation Farragut saw her reel violently from
side to side, lurch heavily over, and then go down
head foremost, her screw revolving wildly in the air
as she disappeared.</p>

<p>It was the supreme moment of his life, in which
the scales of his fortunes wavered in the balance.
All the long years of preparation, of faithful devotion
to obscure duty awaiting the opportunity that
might never come&mdash;all the success attending the two
brief years in which his flag had flown&mdash;all the glories
of the river fights&mdash;on the one side; and on the other,
threatening to overbear and wreck all, a danger he
could not measure, but whose dire reality had been
testified by the catastrophe just befallen under his
own eyes. Added to this was the complication in
the order of battle ahead of him, produced by the
double movements of the Brooklyn and Tecumseh,
which no longer allowed him to seize the one open
path, follow his own first brave thought, and lead his
fleet in person through the narrow way where, if at
all, safety lay. The Brooklyn, when she began to
back, was on the starboard bow of the flag-ship, distant
one or two hundred yards, and falling off to
starboard lay directly in the way athwart the channel.
The second monitor, Manhattan, of the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
class as the Tecumseh, had passed ahead; but the
two light-draughts, the Winnebago and Chickasaw,
were drawing up abreast of the three ships thus
massed together. As they passed, the admiration of
the officers of the flag-ship was stirred to see Captain
Stevens, of the Winnebago, pacing calmly from
turret to turret of his unwieldy vessel, under the full
fire of the fort; while of Perkins, in the Chickasaw,
the youngest commander in the fleet, and then about
twenty-seven years of age, an officer of high position
in the flag-ship says, "As he passed the Hartford he
was on top of the turret, waving his hat and dancing
about with delight and excitement."</p>

<p>But as they went thus gallantly by, the position
of these vessels, combined with that of the Brooklyn
relatively to the flag-ship, forbade the latter's
turning in that direction unless at the risk of adding
to a confusion already sufficiently perilous. A
signal was made and repeated to the Brooklyn to
go ahead; but that vessel gave no sign of moving,
her commander being probably perplexed between
his orders to pass east of the buoy and the
difficulty of doing so, owing to the position into
which his ship had now fallen and the situation of
the monitors. But to remain thus motionless and
undecided, under the fire of the fort with the
other ships coming up to swell the size of the
target offered to its gunners and to increase the
confusion, was out of the question. To advance or
to recede seemed alike dangerous. Ahead lay the
dreaded line of torpedoes; behind was the possibility
of retreat, but beaten, baffled, and disastrous. All
depended upon the prompt decision of the admiral.
If he failed himself, or if fortune failed him now,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
his brilliant career of success ended in the gloom of
a defeat the degree of which could not be foreseen.
In later days, Farragut told that in the confusion of
these moments, feeling that all his plans had been
thwarted, he was at a loss whether to advance or retreat.
In this extremity the devout spirit that ruled
his life, and so constantly appears in his correspondence,
impelled him to appeal to Heaven for guidance,
and he offered up this prayer: "O God, who
created man and gave him reason, direct me what to
do. Shall I go on?" "And it seemed," said the
admiral, "as if in answer a voice commanded, 'Go
on!'"</p>

<p>To such a prompting his gallant temper and
clear intuitions in all matters relating to war were
quick to respond. Personal danger could not deter
him; and if it was necessary that some one ship
should set the example and force a way through the
torpedo line by the sacrifice of herself, he was prepared
by all his habits of thought to accept that
duty for the vessel bearing his flag. Describing the
spirit in which he began an arduous enterprise, after
once deciding that it should be undertaken, he said:
"I calculate thus: The chances are that I shall lose
some of my vessels by torpedoes or the guns of the
enemy, but with some of my fleet afloat I shall
eventually be successful. I can not lose all. I will
attack, regardless of consequences, and never turn
back." To a mind thus disciplined and prepared,
the unforeseen dilemma presented before the barriers
of Mobile Bay caused but a passing perplexity. Like
the Puritan soldier who trusted in God and kept his
powder dry, Farragut met the overthrow of his carefully
arranged plans and the sudden decision thrust<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
upon him with the calm resolution of a man who has
counted the cost and is strengthened by a profound
dependence upon the will of the Almighty. He resolved
to go forward.</p>

<p>The Hartford was now too near the Brooklyn
to go clear by a simple movement of her helm.
Backing hard, therefore, the wheels of the Metacomet,
while turning her own screw ahead, her
bows were twisted short round, as in a like strait
they had been pointed fair under the batteries of
Port Hudson; then, going ahead fast, the two ships
passed close under the stern of the Brooklyn and
dashed straight at the line of the buoys. As they
thus went by the vessel which till then had led, a
warning cry came from her that there were torpedoes
ahead. "Damn the torpedoes!" shouted
the admiral, in the exaltation of his high purpose.
"Four bells!<a name="FNanchor_X_24" id="FNanchor_X_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_X_24" class="fnanchor">[X]</a> Captain Drayton, go ahead! Jouett,
full speed!" The Hartford and her consort crossed
the line about five hundred yards from Mobile Point,
well to the westward of the buoy and of the spot
where the Tecumseh had gone down. As they
passed between the buoys, the cases of the torpedoes
were heard by many on board knocking against
the copper of the bottom, and many of the primers
snapped audibly, but no torpedo exploded. The
Hartford went safely through, the gates of Mobile
Bay were forced, and as Farragut's flag cleared the
obstructions his last and hardest battle was virtually
won. The Brooklyn got her head round, the Richmond
supporting her by a sustained fire from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
heavy broadside; and, after a delay which allowed
the flag-ship to gain nearly a mile upon them, the
other ships in order followed the Hartford, "believing,"
wrote the admiral in his dispatch, "that they
were going to a noble death with their commander-in-chief."</p>

<p>After the flag-ship had passed the torpedo line
the enemy's three gunboats began retreating slowly
up the bay, keeping ahead and on her starboard
bow, where her guns could not bear while their own
raked her. The conditions of the channel did not
yet allow her to deviate from her course in order to
return their fire. At no period of the battle did the
Hartford suffer so much as during the fifteen minutes
she had to endure this galling punishment. The
Tennessee, being inferior in speed to her consorts
as well as to the Hartford, could not accompany this
movement; and, moreover, Buchanan, the Confederate
admiral, had set his heart upon ramming the
vessel that bore the flag of his old friend Farragut.
The Tennessee therefore stood toward the Hartford,
but failed in her thrust, the Union vessel avoiding it
easily with a movement of her helm. The ram then
fired two shots at very short range, but singularly
enough both missed. "I took no further notice of
her," wrote Farragut, "than to return her fire." The
Tennessee followed some little distance up the bay,
and then, changing her mind, turned toward the
column of wooden vessels that was now approaching,
with the three monitors covering their right
flank and somewhat in the rear; these having delayed
to engage the fire of the fort while their more vulnerable
companions went by. The Confederate ironclad
passed along the column from van to rear, ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>changing
shots with most of the vessels in it. The
Monongahela attempted to ram her, but, being embarrassed
by the gunboat lashed alongside, succeeded
only in giving a glancing blow; while the
Oneida, the ship on the fighting side of the rear
couple, already completely disabled in her motive
power by a shot through the boiler, received a raking
broadside, by which her captain, Mullany, lost an
arm.</p>

<p>At the time the Tennessee went about to encounter
the remaining vessels of the fleet, which
was about eight o'clock, the course of the channel
enabled the Hartford to turn sufficiently to bring
her broadside to bear on her puny assailants. By
the fire she then opened, one, the Gaines, was so
much injured as to be with difficulty kept afloat
until she could take refuge under Fort Morgan,
where she was that night burned by her commander.
All three retreated rapidly toward the shoal water
on the east side of the bay. Farragut then signaled
for the gunboats of his fleet to chase those of the
enemy. Jouett, being alongside, received the order
by word of mouth, and the admiral often afterward
spoke with enthusiasm of the hearty "Ay, ay, sir!"
he received in reply, and of the promptness with which
the fasts were cut, the men being already by them,
hatchet in hand. The Metacomet backed clear at
once and started rapidly in pursuit. The gunboats
in the rear followed as soon as the signal was made
out; but, both from their position and from the inevitable
delay in reading signals, they were at a disadvantage.
A thick rain squall coming up soon
after hid both pursuers and pursued from each
other's sight. The Morgan and the Gaines took ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>vantage
of it to change their course for Fort Morgan;
the third Confederate, the Selma, kept straight
on, as did the Metacomet. When the squall cleared,
the latter found herself ahead of her chase. One
shot was fired, killing the first lieutenant and some
of the crew of the Selma, whose flag was then hauled
down. The Morgan made good her retreat under
the fort, and that night succeeded in escaping up the
bay to the city, although she was seen and fired upon
by several of Farragut's vessels.</p>

<p>At half-past eight o'clock, three hours after the
first signal was made to get under way and an hour
and a half after the action began, the flag-ship anchored
in the upper part of the deep pocket into
which the channel expands after passing the entrance.
She was then about four miles from Fort
Morgan, and the crew were sent to breakfast. The
admiral had come down from his post in the main
rigging and was standing on the poop, when Captain
Drayton came up to him and said: "What we have
done has been well done, sir; but it all counts for
nothing so long as the Tennessee is there under the
guns of Morgan." "I know it," replied Farragut,
"and as soon as the people have had their breakfasts
I am going for her." These words were exchanged
in the hearing of the first lieutenant of the Hartford,
now Rear-Admiral Kimberly, and at present the senior
officer upon the active list of the United States
Navy. In writing home a few weeks later, the admiral
said: "If I had not captured the Tennessee as
I did, I should have taken her that night with the
monitors, or <i>tried</i> it." The latter undoubtedly represents
the more deliberate opinion, that would have
guided him had Buchanan not played into his hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
by attacking the fleet; for if the Tennessee had remained
under Morgan and there been sought by the
monitors, the fight would have been at such close
quarters that in the darkness the fort could scarcely
have joined without imminent risk of hurting friend
as well as foe.</p>

<p>As it was, the Confederate admiral seems never
to have contemplated any more prudent or sagacious
course than a single-handed free fight with
the fleet. As soon as the Tennessee had passed
the rear of the enemy's column, Buchanan said to
the captain of the ram: "Follow them up, Johnston;
we can't let them off that way." In turning, the
Tennessee took much room, appearing from the fleet
to have gone back under the guns of Fort Morgan;
and the various ships, as they came up, were anchoring
near the Hartford, expecting a few quiet hours.
They were soon undeceived. The brief conversation
above reported between Farragut and his flag-captain
had scarcely ended when the ram was seen to
be moving out from under the fort. Captain Drayton
reported the fact to the admiral, saying that she
was going outside to attack the United States vessels
still remaining there. "Then," said Farragut,
"we must follow him out." The remark indicates
an alternative to the course actually adopted by
Buchanan, and one whose issue would depend less
upon the United States commander-in-chief than
upon the conduct of the vessels outside. If these
were so imprudent as not to retire, Farragut might
have been forced to run twice again the gantlet of
Fort Morgan and of the torpedo line&mdash;once to protect
them, and afterward to regain the position he
had just achieved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>It must be admitted that the question before the
Confederate admiral, what to do with one unwieldy
though powerful vessel opposed to fourteen enemies,
was hard to solve; nor did he have, in a precise
knowledge of the speed, battery, and other qualities
of his opponents, the data needed for an accurate
solution. In a general way, however, he must have
known that the guns of the United States fleet were
mainly smooth-bores, with but moderate penetrative
power upon iron-plating such as the Tennessee's;
and during the morning's encounter he had acquired
experimental knowledge of their impotence against
her sides, unless by a continuous pounding such as
he was now about to invite. He knew also that several
of the hostile vessels were of too heavy draught
to take any efficient part, if he refused, as was in his
power, to enter the pocket in which they were now
anchored; while the general gentle shelving of the
bottom enabled a foot's difference in draught to
secure a very considerable separation in distance.
Every wooden ship was vulnerable to him and impotent
against him at the ranges which his rifles permitted
him to use.</p>

<p>With the monitors Buchanan had not yet come
into collision; but one of the most formidable was
sunk, and until he had learned something about their
endurance and the power of their guns relatively
to those of his own vessel, it would seem that his
action, though immediate, should have been only
tentative. If it proved on trial that the speed of
the Tennessee was greater than that of the monitors,
she might yet prove master of the situation.
Despite the beak, which her wretched speed and
exposed steering chains rendered untrustworthy, her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
great defensive strength and the fact of carrying
rifled guns indicated that long range, and not close
quarters, was the first game of the Tennessee. There
she could hurt, and she could not be hurt. Had she,
for instance, hovered at a distance, firing deliberately
at the Union vessels, Farragut must have attacked;
and she could then have retired either into shoaler
water, retaining her advantage in range, or else
under the guns of Morgan, which would have
strongly re-enforced her fight. The fact that Farragut,
whose instinct for war was commonly accurate,
proposed to attack her at close quarters and by
night, is the best argument that Buchanan should
have sought long range and daylight for his action.
As it was, his headlong charge into the Union fleet
was a magnificent display of inconsiderate bravery,
in which such advantages as he had were recklessly
thrown away. Its purpose is not clear. If, as Farragut
thought, it was to sink his flag-ship, it can
only be replied that an admiral's flag is not a red
rag for a bull to charge. Had the Hartford been
sunk when the column doubled up an hour or so
before, the loss of the leader at so critical a moment
might have decided the day; but to sink her
in the <i>mêlée</i> within would have been a barren, though
brilliant, feat of arms.</p>

<p>As soon as it was ascertained that the Tennessee
was really coming up to attack, the mess-gear was
hurried aside and the orders given to get under way.
Some of the fleet had not yet anchored, and the
monitors were not yet arrived at the place where
the others were gathered. Dr. Palmer, the fleet
surgeon, was just leaving the flag-ship in a steam-launch,
for the purpose of making a round among<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
the other vessels to see to the condition of their
wounded. Farragut called him alongside and directed
him to go to the monitors with orders to attack the
Tennessee. These Palmer delivered in person to
each ironclad. "Happy as my friend Perkins (of
the Chickasaw) habitually is," he wrote in his diary,
"I thought he would turn a somersault overboard
with joy when I told him, 'The admiral wants you to
go at once and fight that Tennessee.'" The wooden
vessels at the same time were directed to charge the
ram, bows on, at full speed, as well as to attack her
with their guns.</p>

<p>The monitors being, like the Tennessee herself,
very slow, the ramming contest first began. The
first to reach the hostile ironclad was the Monongahela,
Captain Strong, which struck her squarely
amidships on the starboard side, when she was still
four hundred yards distant from the body of the
fleet. Five minutes later the Lackawanna, Captain
Marchand, going at full speed, delivered her blow
also at right angles on the port side, abreast the
after end of the armored superstructure. As they
swung round, both United States vessels fired such
guns as would bear, but the shot glanced harmlessly
from the armor; nor did the blow of the ships themselves
produce any serious injury upon the enemy,
although their own stems were crushed in for several
feet above and below the water line. Upon
them followed the Hartford, approaching, like the
Lackawanna, on the port side; but toward her the
Tennessee turned, so that the two met nearly, though
not exactly, bows on. The Hartford's anchor, which
there had not been time to cat, was hanging at the
water's edge; it took the brunt of the collision,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
which doubled it up, and the two antagonists scraped
by, their port sides touching. At that close range
seven nine-inch guns were discharged against the
sloping sides of the ironclad, but without effect.
The admiral had clambered again into the rigging,
on this occasion into the port mizzen-rigging, whence
he watched the effects of this encounter. Both the
Lackawanna and the Hartford now made a circuit to
get a position whence they could again charge the
enemy; but in the midst of their sweep the Lackawanna
ran square into the flag-ship, striking near
where Farragut stood, and cutting the vessel down
to within two feet of the water. The immediate impression
among the ship's company was that the
injury was fatal; and the general cry that arose,
"Save the admiral! Get the admiral on board the
Lackawanna!" by its ignoring of their own danger,
testified how Farragut's martial and personal qualities
had won a way into the affections of his subordinates.
With an activity for which he had been
remarkable in middle life, and retained even now
when in his sixties, the admiral jumped into the
chains to ascertain the extent of the injury; then,
finding that the ship was in no present danger, he
ordered her again to be headed for the Tennessee.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the monitors had come up, and the
battle had begun between them and the enemy. One
of the Manhattan's fifteen-inch guns had been disabled;
and the slow firing of those unwieldy
weapons, with the imperfect mechanical appliances
then used for loading them, prevented her doing the
injury that might have been expected. One shot
struck square, breaking through the port side of the
armor; but even so the missile itself did not enter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
the vessel, a strong evidence of the power of the
Tennessee to resist a single shot. But she was not
equally invulnerable to the sustained and continuous
hammering of even lighter projectiles. The Winnebago's
turrets, being out of order, could not be
turned, and consequently the guns could be brought
to bear only by moving the helm; a circumstance
which materially reduced her fire. The Chickasaw,
however, was in better case. Lieutenant-Commander
Perkins got her into position under the stern of the
Tennessee just after the latter's collision with the
Hartford; and there he stuck to the end, never over
fifty yards distant, and keeping up a steady rapping
of eleven-inch shot upon the fabric which they could
not at once penetrate, but which they visibly shook.
Fifty-two of these projectiles were fired from the
Chickasaw in the short half-hour of her attack. The
exposed rudder-chains were shot away, and at nearly
the same time the smoke-stack came down. Admiral
Buchanan was wounded by an iron splinter, which
broke his leg and otherwise injured it to such an extent
that the limb was with difficulty saved. He
turned over the command to Captain Johnston, who
stood the pounding for twenty minutes longer and
then reported to his superior that the ship was helpless,
could not be steered, and that for half an hour
he had not been able to bring a gun to bear. "Well,"
replied Buchanan, "if you can not do them any further
damage you had better surrender."</p>

<p>The Tennessee's flag had been several times shot
away, and was now flying from a boat-hook. Not
being very conspicuous, its removal was not immediately
noticed, and Johnston had to show a white flag
to put a stop to the firing. "She was at this time sore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
beset," said Farragut in his dispatch to the Navy
Department; "the Chickasaw was pounding away
at her stern, the Ossipee was approaching her at full
speed, and the Monongahela, Lackawanna, and Hartford
were bearing down upon her, determined upon
her destruction. Her smoke-stack had been shot
away, her steering chains were gone, compelling a
resort to her relieving tackles, and several of her
port shutters were jammed. Indeed, from the time
the Hartford struck her until her surrender she
never fired a gun." No stronger evidence can be
offered than this last sentence, which Johnston's account
corroborates, of how completely Buchanan
miscalculated, or disregarded, the capabilities of the
important vessel he controlled. Great as was her
power to resist a single shot, or the end-on charge
of a heavy vessel, when she surrendered nearly all
the plating on the after side of the casemate was
found to be started, and the after gun-carriage was
disabled; there being distinct marks of nine eleven-inch
solid shot having struck within a few square
feet of that port. Three of her port shutters also
were so damaged that their guns could not be
fired.</p>

<p>Thus ended the great battle of Mobile Bay, the
crowning achievement of Farragut's naval career;
"one of the hardest-earned victories of my life,"
to quote his own words, "and the most desperate
battle I ever fought since the days of the old
Essex." "You may pass through a long career and
see many an action," he remarked to one of the
junior officers of the Hartford, in the interval between
first anchoring and the conflict with the Tennessee,
"without seeing as much bloodshed as you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
have this day witnessed." The loss of the flag-ship
herself had been twenty-five killed and twenty-eight
wounded out of a ship's company of some three
hundred souls. The Brooklyn, a ship of the same
force, had almost exactly the same number of casualties&mdash;eleven
killed and forty-three wounded. Contrasting
the equal suffering of the latter&mdash;delayed
so long under the numerous guns of the fort, but
supported by the fire of the other vessels&mdash;with that
of the flag-ship, inflicted by the batteries of the
enemy's gun-boats, few in number, but worked for
the time with impunity, we find an excellent illustration
of Farragut's oft-repeated maxim, that "to
hurt your enemy is the best way to keep him from
hurting you." The total loss of the United States
fleet in the battle was three hundred and thirty-five;
of whom one hundred and thirteen were at the
bottom of the bay, coffined in the iron hull of the
Tecumseh.</p>

<p>Not quite three hours elapsed from the time that
Morgan fired its first gun to the moment when the
Tennessee hauled down her flag and confessed the
United States fleet mistress of the bay. The forts
still stood with the Confederate flag flying from
them in defiance; and it is reported that the commander
of Morgan retorted to a summons to surrender,
that he looked upon Farragut's fleet as practically
prisoners in a port whose keys he held. If
so, it was the high-hearted resolve of a man determined
to hold his charge to the last, and not the
sober conviction of a soldier, that spoke. Like the
river forts when Farragut's fleet forced its way past
and stood between them and their base of supplies,
the defenses of Mobile were isolated by the results<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
of the morning's fight, and their fall became but a
question of time. There was no mutiny of the garrison,
as on the former occasion, for the stern experience
of war had better taught the men the
business of a soldier; but it was at once practicable
here to begin siege operations, which in the
river would perhaps have been for a time postponed,
owing to the overflowed state of the country. The
preparations for these were pushed with vigor, and
the navy also took a hand against the works. Four
hours after the surrender of the Tennessee, the
Chickasaw weighed her anchor and steamed down
toward Grant's Pass to shell Fort Powell. Built to
resist an attack from Mississippi Sound, the work
was weak in the direction of the bay. "The ironclad's
fire," reported the officer in command, "made
it impossible to man the two guns in the rear, and
I made no attempt to do so." That night the fort
was evacuated and blown up. The following day
the Chickasaw threw some shells into Fort Gaines,
in consequence of which, and of the progress made
by General Granger in his approaches, that work was
surrendered on the 7th of August. Morgan still
standing out, the army was transferred from Dauphin
Island to Mobile Point, batteries were constructed,
and on the 17th a siege train from New Orleans was
landed. On the 22d, at daylight, the siege guns, the
three monitors, the captured Tennessee, and the ships,
both outside and inside the bay, opened together.
The following day Fort Morgan capitulated.</p>

<p>A gratifying feature in these operations, as well
as in all Farragut's official association with the army,
was the cordial good feeling and co-operation which
existed between the two services, and which were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
equally manifested in the upper Mississippi between
Grant and Porter. General Butler, Farragut's first
colleague in the Gulf and at New Orleans, but who
had long since left the department, wrote him a
most enthusiastic letter of congratulation upon receiving
the news of the battle of Mobile Bay; and
General Granger, in concluding his report of the
siege operations against Gaines and Morgan, said:
"I am pleased to record the perfect harmony existing
between these two branches of the service. For
my own part, I can not sufficiently acknowledge the
assistance rendered by the fleet and the admiral in
command in transporting and disembarking the
troops, guns, and materials employed by me in the
operations. In brief, during all our relations, the
officers of the fleet, with their distinguished commander,
displayed in a high degree those qualities
which mark their gallant service." To the officers
of the navy the testimonies thus given can not but
be most grateful; not merely as acknowledgments
of the important part played by a service whose
work is too often ignored by historians, but chiefly
as giving an added lustre to the brilliant reputation
of its two most distinguished representatives, who
successively filled the high position of admiral of the
navy.</p>

<p>After the capitulation of the forts, Admiral Farragut
remained in Mobile Bay until the following
November. The lower bay was cleared of torpedoes
and reconnoissances made toward Mobile; but
he wrote adversely to any attempt against the city,
now that it was sealed as a port to blockade runners.
"It would be an elephant," he wrote, "and take an
army to hold it. And besides, all the traitors and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
rascally speculators would flock to that city and
pour into the Confederacy the wealth of New York."
He confesses also his dislike to operations in very
shoal water. "I am in no way diffident about going
anywhere in the Hartford, but when I have to leave
her and take to a craft drawing six feet of water I
feel badly."</p>

<p>The admiral's health was now suffering much
from the combined effects of his labors, his anxieties,
and the climate. "I am as well as a man can be
who can neither sit, walk, nor stand five minutes at a
time on account of Job's comforters. But, thank
God (I have so much to be thankful for that I am
thanking him all the time), I am otherwise in pretty
good condition." Despite this brave effort at cheerfulness,
his letters from time to time began to show
symptoms of depression, and he longed for rest.
"This is the last of my work," he said, "and I expect
a little respite." His enfeebled condition drew
the attention and excited the alarm of those about
him. "I was talking to the admiral to-day," wrote
Perkins, of the Chickasaw, the day after Morgan surrendered,
"when all at once he fainted away. He is
not very well and is all tired out. It gave me quite
a shock, and shows how exhausted he is, and his
health is not very good, any way. He is a mighty
fine old fellow." Captain Drayton also wrote home
to his family that, if the admiral remained longer in
the Gulf, he feared for the consequences.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances an order from the
Navy Department, dated the 5th of September, assigning
him to the command of the Fort Fisher expedition,
greatly upset him. He had about a week
before written to the Secretary to say that his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
strength was almost exhausted. "I am willing," he
concluded, "to do the bidding of the department as
long as I am able to the best of my abilities. I fear,
however, that my health is giving way. I have now
been down in the Gulf five years out of six, with the
exception of the short time at home last fall; the
last six months have been a severe drag upon me,
and I want rest, if it is to be had."</p>

<p>To so reasonable a request, after such distinguished
and valuable service, the department could
not have closed its ears had it been so disposed.
Farragut was authorized to leave his squadron in
charge of Commodore James S. Palmer, a very gallant
and efficient officer, and to come north in the
Hartford. On the 30th of November, 1864, he sailed
from Pensacola, and on the 12th of December the
flag-ship again anchored in New York Harbor.</p>

<h3>LATER YEARS AND DEATH.<br /><br />

1864-1870.</h3>


<p>With the strong national and patriotic feeling
that had been aroused throughout the Northern
States by the war of secession, Farragut had no
cause to complain of ingratitude or indifference on
the part either of the Government or of his fellow-countrymen.
As the flag-ship entered the Narrows,
on his final return from the Gulf, she was met by a
representative committee from the city officials and
citizens of New York. Enthusiastic crowds greeted
him as he landed at the Battery, and a reception
given him the same afternoon at the Custom House
was thronged by the leading men of the city. This
eager manifestation of good-will and admiration was
followed, a few days later, by a flattering request
that the admiral would honor the city by taking up
his abode in it and becoming thenceforth one of its
citizens. After reciting the deeds which had won
for him universal applause and thankfulness, the
committee said: "The citizens of New York can
offer no tribute equal to your claim on their gratitude
and affection. Their earnest desire is to receive
you as one of their number, and to be permitted, as
fellow-citizens, to share in the renown you will bring<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to the metropolitan city. This desire is felt in
common by the whole community."</p>

<p>This graceful tribute of words was accompanied
by the gift of fifty thousand dollars, to facilitate Farragut's
complying with the request. The letter was
addressed to Vice-Admiral Farragut; the United
States Government, not to be behindhand in acknowledging
its debt to its most distinguished seaman,
having created for him that grade soon after
his arrival. The bill for the purpose was introduced
on the 22d of December, 1864, immediately passed
by both houses, and became law by the President's
signature the following day. Farragut's nomination
and confirmation followed of course and at once; so
that his promotion came to him in the Christmas
holidays. The admiral gratefully acknowledged the
warm welcome of the New Yorkers, while modestly
disavowing, as far as he could, his claim to extraordinary
merit in the brilliant services which he asserted
were but the performance of his duty; and he
thankfully accepted, as the spontaneous offering of
his fellow-countrymen, the recompense which in older
countries is the usual reward of distinguished military
success, but conferred there through the formal
medium of the central government.</p>

<p>Toward the end of January, 1865, the Confederate
vessels in the James made an attempt to descend
the river, destroy the pontoon bridges of the
United States armies, and cut off both the Army of
the James and that of the Potomac from their base
of supplies at City Point. Rear-Admiral David D.
Porter, who then commanded the North Atlantic
Squadron, was fully occupied at the time with the
bombardment of Fort Fisher and capture of Wil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>mington,
North Carolina; and as the hostile attempt
threatened a very serious annoyance to the communications
of the army, Farragut, who was then in
Washington, was ordered to proceed to the spot.
He accordingly hoisted his flag on a small steamer
and ran down to the James; but, finding upon his
arrival that the enemy had been repulsed, and satisfactory
measures taken to prevent a renewal of the
effort, he returned to Washington. This slight episode
concluded his active service in the war.</p>

<p>When Richmond was evacuated on the 2d of
April, 1865, Farragut was among the first to visit the
fallen capital of the Confederacy. From there a few
days later he visited his old home in Norfolk. Many
of his former friends still retained strong feelings of
resentment against him, as a Southern man who had
taken arms against the South. The impression had
obtained among some that, though leaving his old
home, he would remain neutral; and it was even reported
that he had said he would take no part in the
war. That Farragut never passed through that
phase of feeling, in the struggle between life-long
affections and the sense of duty, would be too much
to affirm; but it was a position in which a man of
his decided and positive character could not have
stopped when civil strife was upon the land. It was
inconsistent with his general habits of thought; and
it is evident that, before leaving Norfolk, his convictions
on the particular crisis had already left far
behind any such temporary halting place between
two opinions. When he justified to his excited
neighbors President Lincoln's call for troops, on the
ground that the United States Government could do
no less, when its arsenals and navy yards were seized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and its flag fired upon, it is inconceivable that the man
who then had such courage of his opinions entertained
any further doubt as to his future course; though it
may well be that he did not imperil his personal liberty
and safety by any irritating avowal of his purpose.
In a reception given to him, when he thus revisited
the place which should no longer be his home,
he recalled those days and said: "I was told by a
brother officer that the State had seceded, and that
I must either resign and turn traitor to the Government
which had supported me from my childhood, or
I must leave this place. Thank God! I was not
long in making my decision. I have spent half my
life in revolutionary countries, and I know the horrors
of civil war, and I told the people what I had
seen and what they would experience. They laughed
at me, and called me 'granny' and 'croaker'; and
I said: 'I can not live here, and will seek some other
place where I can live, and on two hours' notice.' I
suppose they said I left my country for my country's
good, and thank God I did! I was unwilling to believe
that this difficulty would not have been settled;
but it was all in vain, and as every man must do in
a revolution, as he puts his foot down, so it marks
his life."</p>

<p>In the summer of 1865, following the close of the
war, Farragut visited several of the New England
cities, receiving everywhere marks of love and admiration
similar to those tendered to him in New
York; but his life for the next two years was
passed in comparative retirement, seeking the re-establishment
of his health, which had been severely
shaken by the exposures and anxieties of the war.
Though for the most part unassigned to any special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
duties, the winding up of the affairs of the West
Gulf Squadron fully occupied his time.</p>

<p>On the 25th of July, 1866, Congress passed a law
creating the grade of admiral in the United States
Navy, a position which was of course given at once
to Farragut, and has been held by but one other&mdash;the
late Admiral David D. Porter. The following
year he was appointed to command the European
Squadron, his flag being hoisted on board the steam
frigate Franklin on the 17th of June, 1867. Without
any request, and indeed without any expectation, on
his part, the Government sent the admiral permission
for Mrs. Farragut and a kinswoman to accompany
him during the cruise. On the 28th of June
the ship sailed from New York,<a name="FNanchor_Y_25" id="FNanchor_Y_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_Y_25" class="fnanchor">[Y]</a> and on the 14th of
July anchored in Cherbourg, France.</p>


<p>After passing a fortnight there, during which the
admiral visited Paris and dined with the Emperor,
the Franklin sailed for the Baltic, where the months
of August and September were passed in visiting the
ports of Russia, Sweden, and Denmark. Everywhere
Farragut was received with the enthusiasm
and distinguished consideration that were aroused
among naval officers, by the presence of the man who
had bestowed upon their profession a lustre unequaled
by any other deeds of that generation.
Toward the end of September he arrived in England,
where a month was spent in a similar gratifying
manner; attentions being lavished upon him by men<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
not only of his own calling, but of all positions.
Here, as in the Baltic, every opportunity was given
Farragut for visiting all objects of general interest,
as well as for examining the professional improvements
of the day.</p>

<p>From England the Franklin went to the Mediterranean,
which Farragut had not seen since the
flying trip made by the Brandywine in the winter of
1825, after landing Lafayette in France. Between
October, 1867, and April, 1868, were visited Lisbon,
Gibraltar, and several ports of the western Mediterranean
belonging to Spain, France, and Italy.
Everywhere the same cordial welcome was extended,
and the most ample facilities enjoyed for seeing
thoroughly the points of interest in which the Mediterranean
abounds. At Nice he was the object of
especial attentions from the numerous Americans
who throng that attractive winter resort; and while
at Naples a special excavation was made at Pompeii
for his benefit. Nowhere, however, did he have a
more elaborate and, from the professional point of
view, more interesting reception than in Malta, the
great British stronghold in the central Mediterranean;
where the Mediterranean fleet, then on the
point of sailing for the Levant, was detained especially
to meet him.</p>

<p>The incidents of this cruise which most nearly
touch Farragut himself, and have the greatest interest
for his biographer, occurred in the island of
Minorca, where his family originated. Over forty
years had passed since, as midshipman and lieutenant,
he had wintered at Port Mahon. During
those early visits he had received messages from
persons living in the interior of the island who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
claimed relationship; but with boyish indifference he
had not responded to any of these advances. Since
that time he had become imbued with the interest
men commonly feel, in advancing years, in collecting
all traces of family history which they can find;
especially when, as in his case, they have been early
and completely separated from the home of their
childhood and of their race. The late George Ticknor
had sent him an old Spanish book, the poems of
Mossen Jaime Febrer, in which he read the account
of his earliest celebrated ancestor, Pedro Ferragut.
Among several escutcheons of the family that have
been preserved, bearing diverse ecclesiastical and
military emblems indicative of the individual's profession,
all contain the common distinguishing device
of a horseshoe; and this the admiral, moved by the
feeling of kinship, had adopted for his plate. Drawn
by these ties of blood and by curiosity, it was a matter
of course that Farragut should visit the famous
harbor for which British, French, and Spaniards had
battled, and which lay within the limits of his command.
The renown of his achievements had carried
his name to Ciudadela, the remote inland city where
his father was born over a century before; and the
quiet islanders, who had exulted in the fame of one
sprung from their race, were ready to greet him and
claim him as their own. In response to an invitation
given by them, the admiral, in December, 1867, paid
a visit to Ciudadela, of which the following account
is given by his secretary, Mr. Montgomery, who accompanied
him on the trip:</p>

<p>"The day after Christmas had been designated
by the admiral for his promised visit to Ciudadela,
in response to the cordial invitation of the authori<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>ties
and people of that city. The news of this tour
of pleasure had spread rapidly to all parts of the
island, and occasioned a general rest from labor and
a popular concentration upon the lines of travel. At
the towns of Alayor and Mercadal flocks of people
of both sexes had assembled on the roadside to unite
with the authorities in tendering our naval chieftain
a cordial welcome, and in expressing their delight at
his advent.</p>

<p>"Although unable to accept the offers of hospitality
which even in these unpretending villages were
showered upon him, the admiral heartily acknowledged
the gratification he felt at their demonstrations
of personal regard, and, passing along the excited
lines, he underwent a siege of hand-shaking.
At these points and elsewhere along the route soldiers
had been stationed to pay him proper honors,
and to tender him any assistance he might require
throughout his journey.</p>

<p>"On his arrival within four miles of Ciudadela
he was formally received by the Alcalde; and a large
committee, comprising many prominent citizens, tendered
the hospitalities of the city, and cordially welcomed
him as its guest. After a brief interchange
of courtesies, he was transferred to a very handsome
barouche, and conducted forward in the van of a
quite formidable-looking procession, demonstrations
of every kind increasing as he approached this
ancient capital of Minorca, the present residence of
many of those who prefer the quiet seclusion of their
island home to the more dazzling notoriety incident
to many of the older and gayer provinces of the
mainland. Outside the walls of the city his appearance
was no sooner heralded than masses of people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
of every age, sex, and condition rushed forward to
greet him, filling the air with cheers and acclamations.
As he passed the gates of the city, the walls,
house-tops, and balconies were crowded with anxious
spectators, uniting demonstrations of welcome with
equally expressive shouts from the swaying multitude
who had taken possession of the principal
thoroughfares. One old man of threescore years
and ten, with tears streaming down his weather-beaten
face, stamped sincerity itself upon the nature
of the welcome by shouting aloud: 'He is ours! he
is ours! but I shall never see him more.'</p>

<p>"The avenue leading to the residence of Señor
Don Gabriel Squella, which had been kindly placed
by that gentleman at the disposal of the admiral
and his suite, was literally blocked with people, and
the excitement rose rapidly to fever heat as the
head of the column appeared in view endeavoring
to make a breach in a body absolutely closed in
mass. It was with no little difficulty that the procession
forced a passage; and although policemen
did their utmost, and jostled, and crowded, and
threatened, accompanying their language with all
the vocabulary of Spanish expletives, it was found
necessary to disembark at some distance from the
hospitable mansion and trust to the humanity of
our entertainers to afford an entrance on foot. But
the temporary concealment of the admiral within the
delightful headquarters which had been assigned
him seemed to be the signal for a renewed outburst,
which brought him to the balcony, upon
which he stood bowing his thanks and acknowledging
in every possible way his heartfelt appreciation
of the cordial welcome extended him, until it ap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>peared
that there was no prospect of a cessation of
hostilities, when, for the first time in his life, he
was persuaded to retreat in the face of superior
numbers.</p>

<p>"The excitement continued unabated, however,
throughout the entire evening, and it was not until
near midnight that the crowd slowly dispersed, and
the peaceful little city of Ciudadela resumed its
wonted quiet, and its order-loving citizens, unaccustomed
to all such sounds of revelry by night,
retired to their own little homesteads.</p>

<p>"During this time a fine band of music was stationed
in the capacious vestibule on the first floor of
Señor Squella's mansion, and almost all the prominent
citizens of the place, with their families, called
to pay their respects to the city's guest, making the
scene of excitement within as pleasant as that without
was tumultuous.</p>

<p>"On the following morning enthusiasm arose with
the sun, once more took firm possession of the street
fronting the headquarters of the admiral, and there
kept anxious watch. I am confident that, had there
been an election that day for Governor of the
Balearic Islands, or for King of Spain itself, the admiral
would have been chosen without opposition.</p>

<p>"At an early hour, accompanied by his entire
suite, all surrounded and followed by an admiring
and excited throng, he was escorted by the committee
and other citizens to all the places of interest
in and about the city, and finally to the cathedral,
in which he had scarcely been seated before it was
literally packed in every part by people, their hundreds
of eyes being riveted upon the pleasant countenance
of the unappalled admiral, who withstood the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
onslaught with as much <i>sang froid</i> as if accustomed
to such trying ordeals.</p>

<p>"Soon after, the great organ pealed forth our
own national melodies, recalling our far-off land
even to those whose knowledge of its power and
glory was limited to its history, and the sparse information
derived from the few Americans who have
visited this secluded city."</p>

<p>After leaving the Mediterranean in April, 1868,
the Franklin went to Holland and Belgium, and
thence made a second visit to England, in the course
of which Farragut was presented to Queen Victoria,
and visited Scotland and the north of England. In
July he returned to the Mediterranean and made a
round of the Levant, visiting Constantinople; a special
indulgence to anchor before the city being accorded
to the ship bearing the flag of an admiral,
whose exceptional achievements made it unlikely
that the privilege would shortly be construed into a
precedent. After a short stay in Athens, and a run
up to Trieste at the head of the Adriatic, the Franklin
returned to Gibraltar, and thence sailed for New
York, which she reached on the 10th of November,
1868; thus concluding a cruise which, from the beginning
to the end, had resembled a triumphal progress
in the enthusiastic recognition everywhere extended
to the hero, whose battle-won blue flag she
carried at her main.</p>

<p>Less than two years of life remained to Admiral
Farragut when he returned from the Mediterranean.
The following summer of 1869 he visited the California
coast, where he had not been since he gave
up the command of the Mare Island Navy Yard in
1858. The welcome here accorded him was as hearty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
as that extended in foreign countries, and mingled
with the admiration due to the conquering admiral
was the recollection of warm mutual affection
and esteem engendered by four years of close
intercourse. Returning from San Francisco to the
East, Farragut was seized at Chicago with a violent
illness, in which the heart was affected. For some
days his life was despaired of; and although by careful
nursing he recovered so as to resume his journey,
it is doubtful whether he ever regained the ground
then lost. Several severe attacks followed this one;
and although he rallied with extraordinary rapidity,
thanks to a vigorous constitution, it was apparent
that his health was failing. A few months later, in
the middle of winter, he consented to take charge of
the naval ceremonies in honor of the remains of Mr.
George Peabody, whose body had been brought to
the United States in the British ship-of-war Monarch,
in recognition of his benevolence to the poor
of London. It was his last official duty, and the exposure
attendant upon funeral ceremonies in that
bleak season was much to be deprecated in a man of
his years and failing vigor.</p>

<p>The following summer the Navy Department
placed at his disposal the dispatch steamer Tallapoosa,
which took him and his family to Portsmouth,
New Hampshire; where he became the guest of the
late Rear-Admiral Pennock, then commandant of the
Navy Yard at that place and a connection by marriage
of Mrs. Farragut. It was his last sea voyage,
and he appeared to have a presentiment that it was
so; for as the ship drew near the yard he arose from
his sick bed at the sound of the salute being fired in
his honor, dressed himself in full uniform, and went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
on deck. Looking up with a sad smile at his flag
flying from the mast-head, he said: "It would be
well if I died <i>now</i>, in harness." Shortly after his
arrival, an old sailor who had charge of the sloop-of-war
Dale, then lying dismantled at the wharf, met
there the admiral, who had wandered on board. He
looked about the ship and, as he left her to go
ashore, said: "This is the last time I shall ever
tread the deck of a man-of-war." This prediction
proved true. He passed quietly away at the commandant's
house, on the 14th of August, 1870, aged
sixty-nine years; surrounded by his family and loving
friends, including many of his old companions in
arms. The body was laid temporarily in Portsmouth,
the naval officers and citizens of the place
uniting to pay every respect to his memory.</p>

<p>In September the Navy Department sent the
steam frigate Guerrière to bring the admiral's body
to New York. This ship running aground on Nantucket
Shoal, the remains were transferred to another
vessel and so conveyed to the city. The final and
public funeral ceremonies were held on the 30th of
September; the day being observed as one of general
mourning, the city edifices draped, bells tolled,
and minute guns fired. In the procession was General
Grant, then President of the United States, with
the members of his Cabinet, many military and naval
officers, ten thousand soldiers, and a large number
of societies. By these the coffin of the admiral was
escorted to the railroad station, whence it was
transported to Woodlawn Cemetery, in Westchester
County, where the body now lies.</p>

<p>To his memory the United States Government
has erected a colossal bronze statue in the national<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
capital, in Farragut Square, the work of Miss Vinnie
Ream. A committee of New York citizens have
placed a similar memorial, by Mr. St. Gauden, at the
northwest corner of Madison Square in that city.
There is also a mural tablet, with a likeness of the
admiral, in the Protestant Episcopal Church of the
Incarnation; of which he was a communicant after
taking up his residence in New York.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>THE CHARACTER OF ADMIRAL FARRAGUT.</h3>


<p>The brilliant and victorious career which has
secured for Farragut a leading place among the successful
naval commanders of all time was of brief
duration, and began at an age when men generally
are thinking rather of relaxing their efforts than of
undertaking new and extraordinary labors. The
two great leaders of the United States armies during
the civil war&mdash;Grant and Sherman&mdash;were not over
forty-five when the return of peace released them
from their cares; while Nelson and Napoleon were
but a year older than these when Trafalgar and
Waterloo terminated their long careers. Farragut
was nearly sixty-one at the time of passing the Mississippi
forts, and his command of the Western Gulf
Squadron lasted not quite three years, or rather less
than the ordinary duration of a naval cruise in times
of peace. Though not unprecedented, the display
of activity and of sustained energy made by him at
such an advanced period of life is unusual; and the
severity of the strain upon the mental and physical
powers at that age is evidenced by the prostration of
Farragut himself, a man of exceptional vigor of
body and of a mental tone which did not increase his
burdens by an imaginative exaggeration of difficul<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>ties.
He never committed the error, against which
Napoleon cautioned his generals, "<i>de se faire un tableau</i>."
On the other hand, the study of his operations
shows that, while always sanguine and ready to take
great risks for the sake of accomplishing a great result,
he had a clear appreciation of the conditions
necessary to success and did not confound the impracticable
with the merely hazardous. Of this, his
reluctance to ascend the Mississippi in 1862, and his
insistence in 1864 upon the necessity of ironclads,
despite his instinctive dislike to that class of vessel,
before undertaking the entrance to Mobile Bay, are
conspicuous illustrations; and must be carefully kept
in view by any one desirous of adequately appreciating
his military character.</p>

<p>As in the case of Nelson, there is a disposition
to attribute Farragut's successes simply to dash&mdash;to
going straight at the enemy regardless of method
and of consequences. In the case of the great
British admiral the tendency of this view, which
has been reproduced in successive biographies down
to the latest, is to sink one of the first of naval
commanders beneath the level of the pugilist, who
in his fighting does not disdain science, to that of
the game-cock; and it is doubtless to be attributed
to the emphasis he himself laid upon that direct,
rapid, and vigorous action without which no military
operations, however wisely planned, can succeed.
In the want of this, rather than of great professional
acquirements, will be most frequently found
the difference between the successful and the unsuccessful
general; and consequently Nelson, who had
seen so much of failure arising from slowness and
over-caution, placed, and rightly placed, more stress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
upon vigor and rapidity, in which most are found
deficient, than upon the methods which many understand,
however ill they may apply them. Like the
distinguished Frenchman, Suffren, who is said to
have stigmatized tactics as "the veil of timidity,"
yet illustrated in his headlong dashes the leading
principles of all sound tactics, Nelson carefully
planned the chief outlines of operations, in the execution
of which he manifested the extremes of daring
and of unyielding firmness. There was in him no
failure to comprehend that right direction, as well
as vigor and weight, is necessary to a blow that
would tell; but experience had taught him that the
average man wants to be much too sure of success
before venturing to move, and hence the insistence
upon that one among the features of his military
character which to the superficial observer has gradually
obscured all others. Vigor even to desperateness
of action both Nelson and Farragut on occasion
showed&mdash;recklessness never. Neither fought as one
who beateth the air; and while for neither can be
claimed an entire exemption from mistakes, the
great outlines of their action can safely challenge
hostile criticism.</p>

<p>While, however, both in their respective spheres
illustrated the great leading principles of war, the
circumstances under which they were called to practice
them were too diverse to permit any close comparison,
or parallel, to be instituted between their
actions. Nelson, for the most part, shone upon the
battle-field&mdash;by his tactical combinations, by the rapidity
and boldness with which he carried out plans
previously laid, or, on occasion, by the astonishing
<i>coup d'&oelig;il</i> and daring with which, in unforeseen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
crises, he snatched and secured escaping victory.
Farragut in actual battle showed that careful adaptation
of means to ends which has a just claim to be
considered tactical science; but his great merit was
in the clearness with which he recognized the decisive
point of a campaign, or of a particular operation,
and threw upon it the force under his direction.
Nelson acted chiefly against ships, against forces of
a type essentially the same as his own, and accessible
in all parts to his attack, because belonging to the
same element; he might therefore hope to overcome
them by the superior quality of his crews or by his
better tactical dispositions. Farragut contended
with fortifications, whose military powers, offensive
and defensive, were essentially different from those of
a fleet. Their endurance so greatly exceeded that of
his ships as to exclude any hope of reducing them by
direct attack; and their advantages of position, deliberately
chosen and difficult of approach, could not
be outweighed by any tactical arrangement open to
him to adopt. He was therefore compelled to seek
their fall by indirect means, by turning and isolating
them, by acting against their communications&mdash;a
conception not tactical, but strategic.</p>

<p>It is not meant to imply that the military talents of
either admiral were confined to the particular field
ascribed to him, but simply that in general they were
led by circumstances to illustrate that chiefly. Nelson
in his fine campaign in the Baltic evinced his profound
intuitions in the science of strategy; and Farragut,
as has been said, showed no mean tactical ability in
the provisions made for his several battles. The dispositions
to be adopted were with him the subject of
very careful consideration; and before Mobile he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
spent hours with his flag lieutenant studying, by the
aid of little wooden models, the different positions in
which the ships might be placed. Afterward he had
the squadron get under way several times to practice
keeping close order, and changing formation and
course.</p>

<p>Like all men who have achieved eminence, the
secret of Admiral Farragut's success is to be found
in natural aptitudes carefully improved, and in a
corresponding opportunity for action. How much
he was indebted to the latter, is evident from the fact
that he had passed his sixtieth year before his
great qualities were manifested to the world. He
was fortunate also, as was Nelson, in the conditions
which he was called to meet. Great as were the
difficulties confronting each, and brilliantly as they
rose to the demand made upon their energies, it
may safely be said that more perfect preparation
upon the part of their enemies would either have
detracted from the completeness of their victories;
or else, by imposing greater deliberation and more
methodical execution, would have robbed their exploits
of that thunderbolt character which imparts
such dramatic brilliancy to the Nile and Trafalgar,
to New Orleans and Mobile Bay. A modern torpedo
line would not leave the gap by which Farragut
first meant to profit, nor would it be crossed
with the impunity he found; nor could Nelson in
his day, without courting destruction, have used
against a thoroughly efficient enemy the tactics that
admirably suited the conditions in Aboukir Bay and
off Cape Trafalgar. But these considerations do
not diminish the credit of either admiral, though
they help to explain the fullness of their success,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
and justify proceedings which under different circumstances
would be unjustifiable. Rather, it may
be said that, in the adaptation of their measures to
the conditions opposed to them, what would otherwise
invite condemnation as rashness, demands recognition
as genius.</p>

<p>For Farragut had a natural genius for war, to
which scarcely any opening had been offered before
the unexpected calamity of the great civil strife burst
upon the country. In estimating his military character
and rightly apportioning the credit due to his
great achievements, much stress must be laid upon
the constant effort for professional improvement
made by him from his early life. "Without the opportunity
and the environment which enabled him
to develop himself," writes one who knew him for
over forty years, "Farragut might have gone to his
rest comparatively unknown; yet among his comrades
and contemporaries in the navy he would have
been recognized as no ordinary man, no merely
routine naval officer, who kept his watch and passed
through life as easily as he could." "He told me,"
writes another, who first met him after his flag was
flying, "that there are comparatively few men from
whom one could not learn something, and that a
naval officer should always be adding to his knowledge;
it might enable him to be more useful some
day; that it was hard to say what a naval officer
might not have to do." Even after the war, when
his reputation was at its height, in visiting European
ports he never for a moment lost sight of this duty
of professional acquirement. Not a harbor was
visited that he did not observe critically its chances
for defense by sea or land. "Who knows," said he,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
"but that my services may be needed here some
day?" "Ah, Mr. Tucker," said Earl St. Vincent to
his secretary when planning an attack upon Brest,
"had Captain Jervis<a name="FNanchor_Z_26" id="FNanchor_Z_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_Z_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a> surveyed Brest when he visited
it in 1774, in 1800 Lord St. Vincent would not have
been in want of his information."</p>

<p>It was not merely in the acquisition of knowledge,
commonly so called, that this practice contributed
to prepare Farragut for his great mission as a
naval commander-in-chief, but also in the discipline
of character and in the development of natural
capacities admirably suited for that position. It
should not be overlooked that before the war, and
now again in our own day, the idea of professional
improvement in the United States Navy has fastened
for its fitting subject upon the development of the
material of war, to the comparative exclusion of the
study of naval warfare. This naturally results from
the national policy, which does not propose to put
afloat a fleet in the proper sense of the word; and
whose ideal is a number, more or less small, of
cruisers neither fitted nor intended for combined
action. Under these circumstances, the details of
the internal economy of the single ship usurp in the
professional mind an undue proportion of the attention
which, in a rightly constituted navy, might far
better be applied to the study of naval tactics, in the
higher sense of that word, and of naval campaigns.
Farragut could not but feel the influence of this tendency,
so strongly marked in the service to which he
belonged; the more so, as it is a thoroughly good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
tendency when not pushed to an exclusive extent.
But here the habit of study, and stretching in every
direction his interest in matters professional, stood
him in good stead, and prepared him unconsciously
for destinies that could not have been foreseen. The
custom of reading had made him familiar with the
biography and history of his profession, the school to
which the great Napoleon recommended all who
would fit themselves for high military command;
and of which a recent distinguished authority has
said that it may be questioned whether a formulated
art of war can be said to exist, except as the embodiment
of the practice of great captains illustrated in
their campaigns.</p>

<p>From these, with his great natural aptitudes for
war, Farragut quickly assimilated its leading principles,
which he afterward so signally illustrated in
act and embodied in maxims of his own that have
already been quoted. He did not employ the terminology
of the art, which, though possibly pedantic
in sound, is invaluable for purposes of discussion;
but he expressed its leading principles in pithy,
homely phrases of his own, which showed how accurate
his grasp of it was. "If once you get in a
soldier's rear, he is gone," was probably in part a bit
of good-natured chaff at the sister profession; but it
sums up in a few words the significance and strategic
importance of his course in passing the batteries of
the river forts, of Port Hudson and of Mobile, and
brings those brilliant actions into strict conformity
with the soundest principles of war. The phrases,
whose frequent repetition shows how deep a hold
they had taken upon him&mdash;"The more you hurt the
enemy the less he will hurt you"&mdash;"The <i>best</i> protec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>tion
against the enemy's fire is a well-directed fire
from our own guns"&mdash;sum up one of the profoundest
of all military truths, easily confessed but with difficulty
lived up to, and which in these days of armor
protection needs to be diligently recalled as a qualifying
consideration. It is, in fact, a restatement of
the oft-admitted, readily-forgotten maxim that offense
is the best defense. "I believe in celerity,"
said he, when announcing his determination soon to
pass the Mississippi forts; and good reason had he to
congratulate himself that this faith showed itself in
his works below New Orleans, and to lament before
Mobile the failure of his Government to observe the
maxim which all acknowledge. "Five minutes,"
said Nelson, "may make the difference between victory
and defeat." "False (circuitous) routes and
lost moments," wrote Napoleon, "are the determining
elements of naval campaigns." All admit the
value of time; but with what apathetic deliberation is
often watched the flight of hours which are measuring
the race between two enemies!</p>

<p>The personal character of Admiral Farragut afforded
the firm natural foundation upon which alone
a great military character can be built; for while no
toleration should be shown to the absurd belief that
military eminence leaps fully grown into the arena,
like Minerva from the head of Jupiter&mdash;that, unlike
every other kind of perfection, it grows wild and
owes nothing to care, to arduous study, to constant
preparation&mdash;it is still true that it can be developed
only upon great natural aptitudes. The distinction
conveyed by a phrase of Jomini, applied to Carnot, the
great war minister of the French Revolution, is one
that it is well for military and naval officers to bear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
constantly in mind. "Carnot," he says, although a
soldier by profession, "was rather a man with a
natural genius for war than an <a name="Page_317t" id="Page_317t"></a><a href="#Page_317tn">accomplished</a> (<i>instruit</i>)
officer;" and to the lack of that studious
preparation which marked Napoleon he attributes
the mistakes which characterized some of Carnot's
projects, although as a whole his career showed profound
intuitions in the conduct of war. It is open
to many able men to be accomplished and valuable
officers; a few only&mdash;how few, the annals of the past
show&mdash;receive the rare natural gifts which in their
perfect combination make the great captain the
highest manifestation of power attainable by human
faculties.</p>

<p>The acquirements of the accomplished officer
may enable him to see the right thing to be done
under given conditions, and yet fail to lift him to
the height of due performance. It is in the strength
of purpose, in the power of rapid decision, of instant
action, and, if need be, of strenuous endurance
through a period of danger or of responsibility,
when the terrifying alternatives of war are vibrating
in the balance, that the power of a great captain
mainly lies. It is in the courage to apply knowledge
under conditions of exceptional danger; not merely
to see the true direction for effort to take, but to
dare to follow it, accepting all the risks and all the
chances inseparable from war, facing all that defeat
means in order thereby to secure victory if it may
be had. It was upon these inborn moral qualities
that reposed the conduct which led Farragut to fame.
He had a clear eye for the true key of a military
situation, a quick and accurate perception of the right
thing to do at a critical moment, a firm grip upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
the leading principles of war; but he might have had
all these and yet miserably failed. He was a man of
most determined will and character, ready to tread
down or fight through any obstacles which stood in
the path he saw fit to follow. Of this a conspicuous
instance was given in the firmness with which he
withstood the secession clamor of Norfolk, his outspoken
defense of the unpopular Government measures,
and the promptitude with which he left the
place, sundering so many associations at the call of
duty; and to this exhibition of strength of purpose,
through the impression made upon Mr. Fox, was
largely due his selection for command in the Gulf.</p>

<p>One of the greatest of naval commanders, whose
experience of men extended through an unusually
long and varied career&mdash;Earl St. Vincent&mdash;has declared
that the true test of a man's courage is his power
to bear responsibility; and Farragut's fearlessness of
responsibility in order to accomplish necessary ends,
while yet captain of a single ship, was the subject of
admiring comment among his subordinates, who are
not usually prone to recognize that quality in their
commanders. "I have as much pleasure in running
into port in a gale of wind," he wrote, "as ever a
boy did in a feat of skill." The same characteristic
was markedly shown under the weight of far greater
issues in his determination to pass the river forts, in
spite of remonstrances from his most able lieutenant,
of cautious suggestions from other commanding officers,
and with only the ambiguous instructions of
the Navy Department to justify his action. It was
not that the objections raised were trivial. They
were of the most weighty and valid character, and
in disregarding them Farragut showed not only the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
admirable insight which fastened upon the true military
solution, but also the courage which dared to
accept on his sole responsibility the immense risks of
disaster which had to be taken.</p>

<p>The same moral force showed itself again, in combination
with the most rapid decision and strength of
purpose, when his ship was nearly thrown on shore
under the batteries of Port Hudson; and yet more in
the highest degree at that supreme moment of his life
when, headed off from the path he had himself laid
down, he led his fleet across the torpedo line in Mobile
Bay. To the same quality must also be attributed the
resolution to take his ships above Port Hudson, without
orders, at the critical period of the campaign of
1863; and it is to be regretted in the interest of his
renown that the merit of that fine decision, both in
its military correctness and in the responsibility assumed,
has not been more adequately appreciated.
For the power to take these momentous decisions,
Farragut was indebted to nature. He indeed justified
them and his general course of action by good
and sufficient reasons, but the reasons carried instant
conviction to him because they struck a kindred
chord in his breast. Speaking on one occasion of
his gallant and accomplished fleet captain, Percival
Drayton, he said: "Drayton does not know fear, and
would fight the devil himself, but he believes in acting
as if the enemy can never be caught unprepared;
whereas I believe in judging him by ourselves, and
my motto in action," he continued, quoting the celebrated
words of Danton, "is, 'L'audace, et encore de
l'audace, et toujours de l'audace.'"</p>

<p>With all his fearlessness and determination, severity
was not one of Admiral Farragut's characteristics.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
He was easily approachable, entering readily into conversation
with all; and added much to the labors of his
position as commanding officer by his great patience
in listening to matters to which a subordinate might
have attended. "His kindness was what most impressed
me," says one officer who was a very young
man when first reporting to him for duty. Another,
who as a midshipman saw much of him, writes: "He
had a winning smile and a most charming manner,
and was jovial and talkative. If any officer or man
had not spontaneous enthusiasm, he certainly infused
it into him." Captain Drayton, who had many opportunities
of observing, once said of him: "I did
not believe any man could be great if he did not
know how to say 'No,' but I see he can; for certainly
here is a great man, and he is too kind-hearted
to say 'No' in some cases where it should
be said."</p>

<p>In person, Admiral Farragut was not above the
medium size&mdash;about five feet six and a half inches
high, upright in carriage, well-proportioned, alert and
graceful in his movements. In early and middle life
he was rather slight than heavy in frame; and it was
not until the war, with the prolonged physical inactivity
entailed by the river and blockade service, that
he took on flesh. Up to that time his weight was
not over one hundred and fifty pounds. He was
very expert in all physical exercises, and retained his
activity to the verge of old age. Even after his fiftieth
year it was no unusual thing for him to call up
some of the crew of the ship under his command and
have a bout with the single-sticks. He felt great
confidence in his mastery of his sword, which he invariably
wore ashore; and when returning to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
wharves at night, through low parts of a town
where there was danger of molestation, he relied upon
it to defend himself. "Any one wearing a sword,"
he used to say, "ought to be ashamed not to be proficient
in its use."</p>

<p>For many years it was his habit on his birthday
to go through certain physical exercises, or, as he
worded it to a young officer of the fleet shortly
before passing the river forts, to take a handspring;
until he failed in doing this he should not,
he said, feel that he was growing old. This practice
he did not discontinue till after he was sixty. A
junior officer of the Hartford writes: "When some
of us youngsters were going through some gymnastic
exercises (which he encouraged), he smilingly
took hold of his left foot, by the toe of the shoe, with
his right hand, and hopped his right foot through the
bight without letting go." The lightness with which
he clambered up the rigging of the flag-ship when
entering Mobile Bay, and again over the side to see
the extent of injury inflicted by the collision with
the Lackawanna, sufficiently prove that up to the
age of sixty-three he was capable of showing upon
occasion the agility of a young man. This bodily
vigor powerfully supported the energy of his mind,
and carried him from daylight to dark, and from vessel
to vessel of his fleet, in seasons of emergency, to
see for himself that necessary work was being done
without slackness; illustrating the saying attributed
to Wellington, that a general was not too old
when he could visit the outposts in person and on
horseback.</p>

<p>The features of the admiral can best be realized
from the admirable frontispiece. As a young man<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
he had the sallow, swarthy complexion usually associated
with his Spanish blood. His hair at the
same period was dark brown, becoming in middle life
almost black. In his later years he was partially
bald&mdash;a misfortune attributed by him to the sunstroke
from which he suffered in Tunis, and which
he to some extent concealed by the arrangement of
the hair. The contour of the face was oval, the
cheek-bones rather prominent, until the cheeks filled
out as he became fleshier during the war; the eyes
hazel, nose aquiline, lips small and compressed. At
no time could he have been called handsome; but
his face always possessed the attraction given by animation
of expression and by the ready sympathy
which vividly reflected his emotions, easily stirred by
whatever excited his amusement, anger, or sorrow.
To conceal his feelings was to him always difficult,
and, when deeply moved, impossible. The old quartermaster
who lashed him in the rigging at Mobile
Bay told afterward how the admiral came on deck
again as the poor fellows who had been killed were
being laid out on the port side of the quarter-deck.
"It was the only time I ever saw the old gentleman
cry," he said, "but the tears came in his eyes like a
little child." A casual but close observer, who visited
him on board the flag-ship in New Orleans, wrote
thus: "His manners are mild and prepossessing, but
there is nothing striking in his presence, and the most
astute physiognomist would scarcely suspect the heroic
qualities that lay concealed beneath so simple
and unpretending an exterior; unless, indeed, one
might chance to see him, as we did shortly afterward,
just on receipt of the news from Galveston, or again
on the eve of battle at Port Hudson. On such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
occasions the flashing eye and passionate energy
of his manner revealed the spirit of the ancient
vikings."</p>

<p>Throughout his life, from the time that as a lad
still in his teens he showed to Mr. Folsom his eagerness
to learn, Farragut was ever diligent in the work
of self-improvement, both professional and general.
His eyes were weak from youth, but he to some extent
remedied this disability by employing readers in
the different ships on board which he sailed; and to
the day of his death he always had some book on
hand. Having an excellent memory, he thus accumulated
a great deal of information besides that
gained from observation and intercourse with the
world. Hobart Pasha, a British officer in the Turkish
Navy and an accomplished seaman, wrote: "Admiral
Farragut, with whom I had many conversations,
was one of the most intelligent naval officers of my
acquaintance." He loved an argument, and, though
always good-tempered in it, was tenacious of his own
convictions when he thought the facts bore out his
way of interpreting their significance. When told by
a phrenologist that he had an unusual amount of
self-esteem, he replied: "It is true, I have; I have
full confidence in myself and in my judgment"&mdash;a
trait of supreme importance to a man called to high
command. But against the defects of this quality he
was guarded by the openness of mind which results
from the effort to improve and to keep abreast of the
times in which one lives.</p>

<p>Farragut was naturally conservative, as seamen
generally tend to be; but while averse to sudden
changes, and prone to look with some distrust upon
new and untried weapons of war, he did not re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>fuse
them, nor did they find in him that prejudice
which forbids a fair trial and rejects reasonable
proof. Of ironclads and rifled guns, both which
in his day were still in their infancy, he at times
spoke disparagingly; but his objection appears to
have arisen not from a doubt of their efficacy&mdash;the
one for protection, the other for length of range&mdash;but
from an opinion as to their effect upon the spirit of
the service. In this there is an element of truth as
well as of prejudice; for the natural tendency of the
extreme effort for protection undoubtedly is to obscure
the fundamental truth, which he constantly
preached, that the best protection is to injure the
enemy. Nor was his instinct more at fault in recognizing
that the rage for material advance, though a
good thing, carries with it the countervailing disposition
to rely upon perfected material rather than
upon accomplished warriors to decide the issue of
battle. To express a fear such as Farragut's, that
a particular development of the material of war
would injure the tone of the service, sounds to some
as the mere echo of Lever's commissary, who reasoned
that the abolition of pig-tails would sap the
military spirit of the nation&mdash;only that, and nothing
more. It was, on the contrary, the accurate intuition
of a born master of war, who feels, even without
reasoning, that men are always prone to rely upon
instruments rather than upon living agents&mdash;to think
the armor greater than the man.</p>

<p>The self-confidence which Farragut exhibited in
his military undertakings was not only a natural
trait; it rested also upon a reasonable conviction of
his mastery of his profession, resulting from long
years of exclusive and sustained devotion. He did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
not carry the same feeling into other matters with
which he had no familiarity; and he was jealously
careful not to hazard the good name, which was the
honor of his country as well as of himself, by attaching
it to enterprises whose character he did not understand,
or to duties for which he did not feel fitted.
Accordingly, he refused a request made to him to
allow his name to be used as director of a company,
accompanied by an intimation that stock representing
one hundred thousand dollars had been placed
in his name on the books. "I have determined," he
replied, "to decline entering into any business which
I have neither the time nor perhaps the ability to
attend to." In like manner he refused to allow his
name to be proposed for nomination as a presidential
candidate. "My entire life has been spent in the
navy; by a steady perseverance and devotion to it
I have been favored with success in my profession,
and to risk that reputation by entering a new career
at my advanced age, and that career one of which I
have little or no knowledge, is more than any one
has a right to expect of me."</p>

<p>Farragut was essentially and unaffectedly a religious
man. The thoughtfulness and care with
which he prepared for his greater undertakings, the
courage and fixed determination to succeed with
which he went into battle, were tempered and graced
by a profound submission to the Almighty will.
Though not obtruded on the public, his home letters
evince how constantly the sense of this dependence
was present to his thoughts; and he has left on
record that, in the moment of greatest danger to his
career, his spirit turned instinctively to God before
gathering up its energies into that sublime impulse,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
whose lustre, as the years go by, will more and more
outshine his other deeds as the crowning glory of
them all&mdash;when the fiery admiral rallied his staggered
column, and led it past the hostile guns and
the lost Tecumseh into the harbor of Mobile.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

Sherman's own zeal in proclaiming the merits of his commander-in-chief,
would probably have always remained unknown. It
would be difficult to find a closer parallel to the difference of
judgment existing between Farragut and Porter at New Orleans:
"When General Sherman first learned of the move I proposed to
make, he called to see me about it. I was seated on the piazza,
engaged in conversation with my staff, when he came up. After
a few moments' conversation, he said he would like to see me
alone. We passed into the house together and shut the door after
us. Sherman then expressed his alarm at the move I had ordered,
saying that I was putting myself voluntarily in a position which
an enemy would be glad to man&oelig;uvre a year&mdash;or a long time&mdash;to
get me in. I was going into the enemy's country, with a large
river behind me, and the enemy holding points strongly fortified
above and below. He said that it was an axiom in war that
when any great body of troops moved against an enemy they
should do so from a base of supplies which they would guard as
the apple of the eye, etc. He pointed out all the difficulties that
might be encountered in the campaign proposed, and stated in
turn what would be the true campaign to make. This was, in
substance, to go back until high ground could be reached on the
east bank of the river, fortify there and establish a depot of supplies,
and move from there, being always prepared to fall back
upon it in case of disaster. I said this would take us back to
Memphis. Sherman then said that was the very place he should
go to, and would move by railroad from Memphis to Granada.
To this I replied, the country is already disheartened over the
lack of success on the part of our armies,... and if we went
back so far as Memphis, it would discourage the people so much
that bases of supplies would be of no use; neither men to hold
them nor supplies to put in them would be furnished. The problem
was to move forward to a decisive victory, or our cause was
lost.... Sherman wrote to my adjutant-general embodying his
views of the campaign that should be made, and asking him to
advise me at least to get the views of my generals upon the subject.
Rawlins showed me the letter, but I did not see any reasons
for changing my plans."&mdash;<i>Personal Memoirs of U. S. Grant</i>,

<p><big><i>MEMOIRS ILLUSTRATING THE HISTORY
OF NAPOLEON I, from 1802 to 1815.</i></big> By Baron <span class="smcap">Claude-François
de Méneval</span>, Private Secretary to Napoleon. Edited
by his Grandson, Baron <span class="smcap">Napoleon Joseph de Méneval</span>.
With Portraits and Autograph Letters. In three volumes.
8vo. Cloth, $6.00.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The Baron de Méneval knew Napoleon as few knew him. He was his confidential
secretary and intimate friend.... Students and historians who wish to form a
trustworthy estimate of Napoleon can not afford to neglect this testimony by one of his
most intimate associates."&mdash;<i>London News.</i></p>

<p>"These Memoirs, by the private secretary of Napoleon, are a valuable and important
contribution to the history of the Napoleonic period, and necessarily they throw
new and interesting light on the personality and real sentiments of the emperor. If
Napoleon anywhere took off the mask, it was in the seclusion of his private cabinet.
The Memoirs have been republished almost as they were written, by Baron de Méneval's
grandson, with the addition of some supplementary documents."&mdash;<i>London Times.</i></p>

<p>"Méneval has brought the living Napoleon clearly before us in a portrait, flattering,
no doubt, but essentially true to nature; and he has shown us what the emperor really
was&mdash;at the head of his armies, in his Council of State, as the ruler of France, as the
lord of the continent&mdash;above all, in the round of his daily life, and in the circle of family
and home."&mdash;<i>London Academy.</i></p>

<p>"Neither the editor nor translator of Méneval's Memoirs has miscalculated his deep
interest&mdash;an interest which does not depend on literary style but on the substance of
what is related. Whoever reads this volume will wait with impatience for the remainder."&mdash;<i>N.
Y. Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"The work will take rank with the most important of memoirs relating to the period.
Its great value arises largely from its author's transparent veracity. Méneval was one
of those men who could not consciously tell anything but the truth. He was constitutionally
unfitted for lying.... The book is extremely interesting, and it is as important
as it is interesting."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Times.</i></p>

<p>"Few memorists have given us a more minute account of Napoleon.... No lover
of Napoleon, no admirer of his wonderful genius, can fail to read these interesting and
important volumes which have been waited for for years.<i>"&mdash;N. Y. World.</i></p>

<p>"The book will be hailed with delight by the collectors of Napoleonic literature, as
it covers much ground wholly unexplored by the great majority of the biographers of
Napoleon."&mdash;<i>Providence Journal.</i></p>

<p>"Méneval made excellent use of the rare opportunity he enjoyed of studying closely
and at close range the personality of the supreme genius in human history."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Press.</i></p>

<p>"Of all the memoirs illustrating the history of the first Napoleon&mdash;and their number
is almost past counting&mdash;there is probably not one which will be found of more
value to the judicious historian, or of more interest to the general reader, than these....
Méneval, whose Memoirs were written nearly fifty years ago, had nothing either
to gain or to lose; his work, from the first page to the last, impresses the reader with a
deep respect for the author's talent, as well as his absolute honesty and loyalty."&mdash;<i>N.
Y. Independent.</i></p>

<p>"These Memoirs constitute an important contribution to the understanding of Napoleon's
character. They are evidently written in good faith, and, as the writer had
remarkable opportunities of observation, they must be accepted as authentic testimony
to the existence in Napoleon of gentle, humane, sympathetic, and amiable qualities,
with which he has not been often credited."&mdash;<i>N. Y. Sun.</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em"><big><i>GERMANY AND THE GERMANS.</i> By <span class="smcap">William
Harbutt Dawson</span>, author of "German Socialism and
Ferdinand Lassalle," "Prince Bismarck and State Socialism,"
etc. 2 vols., 8vo. Cloth, $6.00.</big></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"This excellent work&mdash;a literary monument of intelligent and conscientious labor&mdash;deals
with every phase and aspect of state and political activity, public and private,
in the Fatherland.... Teems with entertaining anecdotes and introspective <i>aperçus</i>
of character."&mdash;<i>London Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>"With Mr. Dawson's two volumes before him, the ordinary reader may well dispense
with the perusal of previous authorities.... His work, on the whole, is comprehensive,
conscientious, and eminently fair."&mdash;<i>London Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Dawson has made a remarkably close and discriminating study of German
life and institutions at the present day, and the results of his observations are set forth
in a most interesting manner."&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Times.</i></p>

<p>"There is scarcely any phase of German national life unnoticed in his comprehensive
survey.... Mr. Dawson has endeavored to write from the view-point of a sincere
yet candid well-wisher, of an unprejudiced observer, who, even when he is unable to
approve, speaks his mind in soberness and kindness."&mdash;<i>New York Sun.</i></p>

<p>"There is much in German character to admire; much in Germany's life and institutions
from which Americans may learn. William Harbutt Dawson has succeeded in
making this fact clearer, and his work will go far to help Americans and Germans to
know each other better and to respect each other more.... It is a remarkable and a
fascinating work."&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>"One of the very best works on this subject which has been published up to date."&mdash;<i>New
York Herald.</i></p>
</div>

<p style="margin-top: 2em"><big><i>A HISTORY OF GERMANY, from the Earliest
Times to the Present Day.</i> By <span class="smcap">Bayard Taylor</span>. With an
Additional Chapter by <span class="smcap">Marie Hansen-Taylor</span>. With Portrait
and Maps. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.</big></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"There is, perhaps, no work of equal size in any language which gives a better
view of the tortuous course of German history. Now that the story of a race is to be
in good earnest a story of a nation as well, it begins, as every one, whether German or
foreign, sees, to furnish unexpected and wonderful lessons. But these can only be
understood in the light of the past. Taylor could end his work with the birth of the
Empire, but the additional narrative merely foreshadows the events of the future. It
may be that all the doings of the past ages on German soil are but the introduction of
what is to come. That is certainly the thought which grows upon one as he peruses
this volume."&mdash;<i>New York Tribune.</i></p>

<p>"When one considers the confused, complicated, and sporadic elements of German
history, it seems scarcely possible to present a clear, continuous narrative. Yet this is
what Bayard Taylor did. He omitted no episode of importance, and yet managed to
preserve a main line of connection from century to century throughout the narrative."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Ledger.</i></p>

<p>"A most excellent short history of Germany.... Mrs. Taylor has done well the
work she reluctantly consented to undertake. Her story is not only clearly told, but
told in a style that is quite consistent with that of the work which she completes....
As a matter of course the history excels in its literary style. Mr. Taylor could not
have written an entertaining book. This book arouses interest in its opening chapter
and maintains it to the very end."&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>"Probably the best work of its kind adapted for school purposes that can be had in
English."&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em"><big><i>THE TRUE LIFE OF CAPTAIN SIR RICHARD
F. BURTON.</i> Written by his niece, <span class="smcap">Georgiana M.
Stisted</span>, with the authority and approval of the Burton family.
12mo. Cloth, with Portrait, $2.00.</big></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Miss Stisted has given us a thoroughly good biography. Though a great admirer
of her uncle, she does not conceal his weaknesses, but writes, in the main, soberly and
impartially with excellent judgment. She has compressed a great deal into a small volume,
not confusing us with too much detail, and yet describing many picturesque
incidents and scenes. Her book is interesting from beginning to end. Short as it is,
we get from it a satisfactory idea of the story and personality of one of the most extraordinary
men of his time."&mdash;<i>The Nation.</i></p>

<p>"The book has not a dull line in it. Detail, anecdote, comment, and criticism are
so nicely adjusted that the story never flags."&mdash;<i>Chicago Evening Post.</i></p>

the period, and to the astonishing standard which the musician had to attain before
even recognition was assured by the extremely critical music-loving class of that time."&mdash;<i>San

<p>"As a mere story the book is extremely interesting, while as a psychological as
well as a musical study the early life of Hans von Bülow, as mirrored forth in these
letters, is of no small import."&mdash;<i>New York Mail and Express.</i></p>

<p>"This volume introduces the Von Bülow not known to the present generation.
The letters are free, spontaneous, and unstudied, exhibiting the musician struggling
to make what he knew to be in him recognized by the public."&mdash;<i>London Daily

<p>"A monumental volume, which no American who cares for the memory of the public
men of his country can afford to be without."&mdash;<i>New York Mail and Express.</i></p>

<p>"Just the sort of book that the American who wishes to fix in his mind the varying
phases of his country's history as it is woven on the warp of the administrations

<p>"General Wilson has performed a public service in presenting this volume to the
public in so attractive a shape. It is full of incentive to ambitious youth; it abounds
in encouragement to every patriotic heart."&mdash;<i>Charleston News and Courier.</i></p>

<p>"There is an added value to this volume because of the fact that the story of the

<p>"Such a work as this can not fail to appeal to the pride of patriotic Americans."&mdash;<i>Chicago

A new volume in the Anthropological Series, edited by Professor
<span class="smcap">Frederick Starr</span>. Illustrated. 12mo. Cloth, $1.75.</big></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This is an inquiry into the laws which control the life and development of art, and
into the relations existing between it and certain forms of civilization. The origin of
an artistic activity should be sought among the most primitive peoples, like the native
Australians, the Mincopies of the Andaman Islands, the Botocudos of South America,
and the Eskimos; and with these alone the author studies his subject. Their arts are
regarded as a social phenomenon and a social function, and are classified as arts of rest
and arts of motion. The arts of rest comprise decoration, first of the body by scarification,
painting, tattooing, and dress; and then of implements&mdash;painting and sculpture;
while the arts of motion are the dance (a living sculpture), poetry or song, with rhythm,
and music.</p>

Hoffman</span>, M. D. With numerous Illustrations. 12mo. Cloth,
$1.75.</big></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>This interesting book gives a most attractive account of the rude methods employed
by primitive man for recording his deeds. The earliest writing consists of pictographs
which were traced on stone, wood, bone, skins, and various paperlike substances. Dr.
Hoffman shows how the several classes of symbols used in these records are to be interpreted,
and traces the growth of conventional signs up to syllabaries and alphabets&mdash;the
two classes of signs employed by modern peoples.</p>

<p>"... Prof. McMaster has told us what no other
historians have told.... The skill, the animation, the
brightness, the force, and the charm with which he arrays
the facts before us are such that we can hardly
conceive of more interesting reading for an American
citizen who cares to know the nature of those causes
which have made not only him but his environment
and the opportunities life has given him what they are."&mdash;<i>N.
Y. Times.</i></p>

<p>"Those who can read between the lines may discover in these pages constant
evidences of care and skill and faithful labor, of which the old-time superficial essayists,
compiling library notes on dates and striking events, had no conception; but
to the general reader the fluent narrative gives no hint of the conscientious labors,
far-reaching, world-wide, vast and yet microscopically minute, that give the strength
and value which are felt rather than seen. This is due to the art of presentation.
The author's position as a scientific workman we may accept on the abundant testimony
of the experts who know the solid worth of his work; his skill as a literary
artist we can all appreciate, the charm of his style being self-evident."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia
Telegraph.</i></p>

<p>"The third volume contains the brilliantly written and fascinating story of the progress
and doings of the people of this country from the era of the Louisiana purchase
to the opening scenes of the second war with Great Britain&mdash;say a period of ten years.
In every page of the book the reader finds that fascinating flow of narrative, that
clear and lucid style, and that penetrating power of thought and judgment which distinguished
the previous volumes."&mdash;<i>Columbus State Journal.</i></p>

<p>"Prof. McMaster has more than fulfilled the promises made in his first volumes,
and his work is constantly growing better and more valuable as he brings it nearer
to our own time. His style is clear, simple, and idiomatic, and there is just enough
of the critical spirit in the narrative to guide the reader."&mdash;<i>Boston Herald.</i></p>

<p>"Take it all in all, the History promises to be the ideal American history. Not so
much given to dates and battles and great events as in the fact that it is like a great
panorama of the people, revealing their inner life and action. It contains, with all its
sober facts, the spice of personalities and incidents, which relieves every page from
dullness."&mdash;<i>Chicago Inter-Ocean.</i></p>

<p>"History written in this picturesque style will tempt the most heedless to read.
Prof. McMaster is more than a stylist; he is a student, and his History abounds in
evidences of research in quarters not before discovered by the historian."&mdash;<i>Chicago
Tribune.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Few works on the period which it covers can compare with this in point of mere
literary attractiveness, and we fancy that many to whom its scholarly value will not appeal
will read the volume with interest and delight."&mdash;<i>New York Evening Post.</i></p>

<p>"Written with a firm grasp of the theme, inspired by ample knowledge, and made
attractive by a vigorous and resonant style, the book will receive much attention. It
is a great theme the author has taken up, and he grasps it with the confidence of a
master."&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Eggleston's 'Beginners' is unique. No similar historical study has, to our
knowledge, ever been done in the same way. Mr. Eggleston is a reliable reporter of
facts; but he is also an exceedingly keen critic. He writes history without the effort
to merge the critic in the historian. His sense of humor is never dormant. He renders
some of the dullest passages in colonial annals actually amusing by his witty treatment
of them. He finds a laugh for his readers where most of his predecessors have found
yawns. And with all this he does not sacrifice the dignity of history for an instant."&mdash;<i>Boston
Saturday Evening Gazette.</i></p>

<p>"The delightful style, the clear flow of the narrative, the philosophical tone, and
the able analysis of men and events will commend Mr. Eggleston's work to earnest
students."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Public Ledger.</i></p>

<p>"The work is worthy of careful reading, not only because of the author's ability as a
literary artist, but because of his conspicuous proficiency in interpreting the causes of
and changes in American life and character."&mdash;<i>Boston Journal.</i></p>

<p>"It is noticeable that Mr. Eggleston has followed no beaten track, but has drawn
his own conclusions as to the early period, and they differ from the generally received
version not a little. The book is stimulating and will prove of great value to the student
of history."&mdash;<i>Minneapolis Journal.</i></p>

<p>"A very interesting as well as a valuable book.... A distinct advance upon most
that has been written, particularly of the settlement of New England."&mdash;<i>Newark
Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>"One of the most important books of the year. It is a work of art as well as of
historical science, and its distinctive purpose is to give an insight into the real life and
character of people.... The author's style is charming, and the history is fully as interesting
as a novel."&mdash;<i>Brooklyn Standard-Union.</i></p>

<p>"The value of Mr. Eggleston's work is in that it is really a history of 'life,' not
merely a record of events.... The comprehensive purpose of his volume has been
excellently performed. The book is eminently readable."&mdash;<i>Philadelphia Times.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"The merit of this work is intrinsic. It rests on the broad intelligence and true
philosophy of the method employed, and the coherency and accuracy of the results
reached. The scope of the work is marvelous. Never was there more crowded into
three small volumes. But the saving of space is not by the sacrifice of substance or
of style. The broadest view of the facts and forces embraced by the subject is exhibited
with a clearness of arrangement and a definiteness of application that render it perceptible
to the simplest apprehension."&mdash;<i>New York Mail and Express.</i></p>

<p>"In 'The Little Regiment' we have again studies of the volunteers waiting impatiently
to fight and fighting, and the impression of the contest as a private soldier hears,
sees, and feels it, is really wonderful. The reader has no privileges. He must, it seems,
take his place in the ranks, and stand in the mud, wade in the river, fight, yell, swear,
and sweat with the men. He has some sort of feeling, when it is all over, that he has
been doing just these things. This sort of writing needs no praise. It will make its
way to the hearts of men without praise."&mdash;<i>New York Times.</i></p>
